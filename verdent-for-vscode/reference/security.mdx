## Your Code's Privacy

### Code Processing

**How Verdent processes your code:**
- Code is transmitted to AI model servers for processing
- Processing occurs in real-time during active sessions
- No permanent storage of your code beyond session context

**What Verdent can access:**
- Files you explicitly work with during conversations
- Project files read through file tools (file_read, glob, grep_content, grep_file)
- Command outputs from bash tool executions
- Chat conversation history within the session

**What Verdent cannot access:**
- Files not opened or referenced during conversations
- Other VS Code windows or workspaces
- System files outside VS Code workspace
- Personal data unrelated to coding tasks

---

### Data Transmission

**Secure Communication:**
- All data transmitted over encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS)
- Communication between VS Code extension and AI servers is encrypted
- No third-party access to transmission channels

**Internet Requirement:**
Verdent requires an active internet connection to function. Code is sent to remote AI model servers for processing and cannot operate offline.

---

## Data Handling Policy

### Data Collection

**What data Verdent collects:**
- Code snippets processed during active sessions
- Chat conversation history
- File operations performed (read, edit, write)
- Tool usage patterns and commands executed
- Error logs and diagnostic information

**Purpose of collection:**
- Provide AI-powered coding assistance
- Improve model responses and accuracy
- Debug technical issues
- Enhance user experience

---

### Data Retention

<Info>
Specific data retention policies, including how long conversation history and code snippets are retained, are managed by Verdent. Contact support@verdent.ai for detailed retention policy documentation.
</Info>

**Session data:**
- Active conversation context maintained during session
- Context cleared when starting new conversation
- Subagent contexts isolated and cleared after task completion

**Your rights:**
For information about accessing, modifying, or deleting your data, contact support@verdent.ai.

---

### Data Sharing

**Third-party sharing:**
Verdent processes code using AI model providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google). Your code is transmitted to these providers' servers for processing.

**What is not shared:**
- Code is not sold to third parties
- No advertising or marketing use of your code
- No public disclosure of proprietary code

<Warning>
Be cautious when working with sensitive or proprietary code. Use Manual Accept Mode to review all operations before execution. Never include credentials, API keys, or secrets in code processed by Verdent.
</Warning>

## Security Best Practices

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Safe Usage">
    ### Safe Usage Practices

    **1. Use Manual Accept Mode for sensitive projects:**
    Click "Switch Permission" button in Input Box → Select "Manual Accept Mode"

    Review all file operations and commands before approval.

    **2. Never include secrets in code:**
    - Avoid hard-coded API keys, passwords, or credentials
    - Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
    - Review bash commands for credential exposure

    **3. Workspace isolation:**
    - Verdent operates within current VS Code workspace only
    - Sensitive projects should be in separate workspaces
    - Use project-specific AGENTS.md for security rules

    **4. Code review:**
    Use @Code-reviewer subagent for security analysis:
    ```
    @Code-reviewer review this code for security vulnerabilities
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="MCP Security">
    ### MCP Security

    **External integrations:**
    When using MCP servers for database or API access:
    - Configure read-only access when possible
    - Use minimal necessary permissions
    - Store credentials in MCP config (`~/.verdent/mcp.json`), not in code
    - Validate MCP server sources before installation

    **Production databases:**
    Configure production database MCP servers as read-only to prevent accidental modifications.

    <Warning>
    Always configure production database MCP servers with read-only access to prevent accidental data modifications.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Bash Safety">
    ### Bash Command Safety

    **Command execution risks:**
    - Bash commands execute with your user permissions
    - Destructive commands (rm, drop, truncate) can cause data loss
    - Commands may access files outside VS Code workspace

    **Mitigation:**
    - Always use Manual Accept Mode for production environments
    - Review all bash commands before execution
    - Avoid sudo commands unless absolutely necessary
    - Use AGENTS.md rules to enforce safe practices

    **Example safe rule:**
    ```markdown
    # AGENTS.md
    ## Security Rules
    - NEVER run bash commands with sudo
    - All destructive operations require explicit confirmation
    - No direct database modifications in production
    ```
  </Tab>
