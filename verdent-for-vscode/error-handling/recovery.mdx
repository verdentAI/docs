## Interpreting Error Messages

<Warning>
Detailed error message interpretation guide is under development. For specific error messages you encounter, use the Feedback button or Discord community for assistance.
</Warning>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Server-Side Errors">
    Server-side errors are temporary and usually resolve by waiting. No action required beyond retrying after a few minutes.

    **Look for these keywords:**
    - "Overloaded" or "at capacity"
    - "Internal server error" or "backend processing"
    - "503 Service Unavailable" or "no healthy upstream"
    - "Rate limit" or "quota"

    **What to do:**
    - Wait 5-10 minutes before retrying
    - Continue local development work
    - Review code changes made so far
    - Commit current work to Git

    **General Rule:** If the error message mentions server status, capacity, or rate limits, it's temporary. These are infrastructure issues that resolve automatically.

    <Note>
    Temporary server errors (502, 503, 504) usually resolve within minutes—wait 2-3 minutes before retrying.
    </Note>

    **When to escalate:**
    - Error persists beyond 15 minutes
    - Check Discord for outage reports
    - Look for status page updates
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Client-Side Errors">
    Client-side errors require action on your part. These won't resolve by waiting.

    **Look for these indicators:**
    - Authentication or credential-related messages
    - Configuration or settings errors
    - File permission errors
    - Network connection failures

    **What to do:**
    - **Authentication errors**: Re-authenticate through User Center, verify subscription active
    - **Configuration errors**: Review recent setting changes, verify configuration files
    - **Permission errors**: Check file/folder permissions, verify workspace access
    - **Network errors**: Test internet connection, try different network, check VPN/firewall

    **General Rule:** If the error mentions authentication, configuration, permissions, or local settings, you need to take corrective action.

    **Troubleshooting steps:**
    1. Read full error message for specific guidance
    2. Identify which component reported error (auth, config, permissions, network)
    3. Take targeted action based on error type
    4. Verify fix by retrying original operation
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Reading Error Context

When errors occur:
1. **Read the full error message** - Don't skip details
2. **Note error codes** - Specific codes help diagnose issues
3. **Identify the component** - What system reported the error (server, API, local)
4. **Check timing** - Did it happen immediately or after delay?

## Systematic Troubleshooting

Follow these progressive steps when Verdent behaves unexpectedly, starting with least disruptive actions.

### Initial Response

<Steps>
  <Step title="Wait and Observe">
    Check if behavior is consistent or intermittent. Note what action triggered the unexpected behavior. Don't immediately assume something is broken - many issues are temporary.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Basic Restart">
    Restart Verdent for VS Code (close and reopen VS Code). Often resolves stuck states or performance issues. This is the simplest first troubleshooting step.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Progressive Troubleshooting

If basic restart doesn't resolve the issue:

<Tip>
Follow the systematic troubleshooting steps in order, skipping steps often means missing the root cause.
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Network Connection">
    Test internet connection with other websites. Try on different network (mobile hotspot) to rule out firewall/VPN issues. Check if corporate network is blocking connections.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Configuration">
    Check that you're still authenticated. Verify subscription is active in User Center. Review recent setting changes that might affect behavior.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Seek Help">
    Check Discord community for similar reports: https://discord.com/invite/NGjXEZcbJq. Use Feedback button to report the issue. Include description of unexpected behavior and steps to reproduce.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What NOT to Do

Avoid these actions for temporary issues:

- Don't immediately reinstall Verdent
- Don't clear VS Code cache or application data
- Don't modify system settings for temporary issues
- Don't restart computer unless other applications are also affected

<Warning>
In Manual Accept Mode, never approve destructive operations (rm, DROP, DELETE) without carefully reviewing the exact command.
</Warning>

**Why?** These actions are time-consuming and rarely fix issues. Most problems resolve with simple restart or waiting for temporary server issues to clear.

## When to Wait vs When to Act

Understanding whether to wait or take action prevents wasted troubleshooting effort.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Wait It Out (5-10 min)">
    These errors resolve automatically - no action needed beyond waiting and retrying.

    **Server overload or capacity errors:**
    - "Overloaded" or "at capacity" messages
    - High traffic periods
    - Temporary service disruptions

    **Rate limiting:**
    - "Rate limit" or "quota exceeded" messages
    - Too many requests in short time
    - API throttling protection

    **Intermittent connection issues:**
    - Occasional failed requests that succeed on retry
    - Network hiccups
    - Brief connectivity drops

    **What to do while waiting:**
    - Continue local development work
    - Review code changes made so far
    - Plan next steps or todos
    - Commit current work to Git

    **How long to wait:**
    - Standard wait: 5-10 minutes
    - If still failing after 10 minutes, switch to troubleshooting
    - Check Discord for reports of widespread issues
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Take Action Immediately">
    These errors won't resolve by waiting - you must take corrective action.

    **Authentication failures:**
    - Session expired → Re-authenticate through User Center
    - Invalid credentials → Verify subscription active
    - Need to re-authenticate → Check User Center

    **Persistent errors (10+ minutes):**
    - Same error repeatedly after multiple retries → Start troubleshooting
    - Consistent failure pattern → Check configuration
    - Error persists across restarts → Verify environment

    **Configuration issues:**
    - Settings changed recently → Review and revert changes
    - New setup or installation → Verify configuration files
    - Changed network environment → Test connectivity

    **Permission errors:**
    - File system access denied → Check file/folder permissions
    - Workspace restrictions → Verify workspace access
    - Folder permissions → Grant necessary permissions

    **Network problems:**
    - Complete inability to connect → Test internet connection
    - VPN or firewall blocking → Try different network
    - Corporate network restrictions → Contact IT support

    **Decision rule:**
    - Server/rate errors → Wait
    - Auth/config/permission/network → Act immediately
    - Not sure? → Wait 5-10 minutes first, then act if persists
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
