## Execution Modes

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Manual Accept Mode">
    Manual Accept Mode is the default execution mode that provides control over file modifications and command execution.

    **Automatic Operations:**
    - File reading and code analysis
    - Directory browsing

    **Requires Permission:**
    - File editing (create, modify, delete)
    - Command execution (terminal commands, tests, builds)

    When Verdent needs to perform a protected operation, it shows what action it wants to take and which file/command is involved. You can **Accept** or **Reject** each operation.

    **Important:** Each permission is for that specific operation only. Manual Accept Mode requires approval for every protected operation throughout the session.

    #### When to Use

    - Learning Verdent's capabilities and workflow patterns
    - Working in unfamiliar codebases requiring careful oversight
    - Critical changes to production code or security-sensitive areas
    - Compliance requirements needing explicit approval trails

    #### Activation

    Manual Accept Mode is active by default. To switch back:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Open Permission Menu">
        Click "Switch Permission" button in Input Box
      </Step>
      <Step title="Select Manual Accept Mode">
        Choose "Manual Accept Mode" from the dropdown
      </Step>
      <Step title="Verify Activation">
        Button displays "Manual" to confirm mode is active
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    #### Safety Considerations

    **Advantages:**
    - First-use approval per tool type (file edits, commands, tools)
    - Complete visibility before granting access
    - Maximum control and transparency

    **Limitations:**
    - After first approval of a tool type, subsequent uses proceed without prompts
    - Approval is per tool type, not per operation
    - Start new sessions when working on critical code to reset tool approvals
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Auto-Run Mode">
    Auto-Run Mode automatically approves file operations while requiring permission for commands. This reduces permission prompts for routine file work while maintaining safety for risky operations.

    **Automatic:**
    - File reading, editing, creating, deleting within workspace
    - Moving, renaming, organizing files within workspace
    - File search and navigation operations

    **Requires Permission:**
    - **Any command involving paths outside the current workspace**
    - **Dangerous bash commands:** `rm -rf`, `git commit`, `git push`, etc.
    - Command execution (terminal, scripts, builds)
    - Package installation and system modifications

    #### When to Use

    | Use Auto-Run For | Don't Use For |
    |------------------|---------------|
    | Trusted codebases with version control | Unfamiliar codebase |
    | Rapid prototyping and experimentation | Critical production code |
    | Multi-file refactoring (15+ files = 15 prompts saved) | No version control safety net |
    | Focused development minimizing interruptions | Compliance requirements |

    #### Activation

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Open Permission Menu">
        Click "Switch Permission" button showing current mode
      </Step>
      <Step title="Select Auto-Run Mode">
        Choose "Auto-Run Mode" from the dropdown
      </Step>
      <Step title="Verify Activation">
        Button displays "Auto" to confirm mode is active
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    Persists across sessions and VS Code restarts. Applies globally to all workspaces.

    #### Example Workflow

    **Building a POST /api/tasks endpoint:**

    1. Activate Auto-Run Mode
    2. Submit: "Create POST /api/tasks endpoint that validates category exists, saves to database"
    3. Verdent reads 5+ files, modifies 3 files automatically (no prompts)
    4. Review changes in Source Control panel
    5. Request tests: "Run the tests for the tasks API"
    6. Permission prompt for `npm test` command - Accept
    7. Add validation: "Add validation for empty titles"
    8. Verdent edits automatically (no prompt)
    9. Request tests again - Permission prompt - Accept
    10. Review diffs, commit changes

    **Result:** 3 command prompts, 0 file prompts. Manual Accept would require 4 additional file prompts.

    #### Safety Considerations

    **Advantages:**
    - Changes immediately visible in VS Code
    - Workspace-scoped (cannot affect system files)
    - Git provides rollback safety

    **Risks:**
    - No file operation oversight
    - Unexpected scope ("Rename User to Account" might modify dozens of files)
    - File deletion possible during cleanup
    - Could modify sensitive files if prompted

    **Mitigation:**
    - Use clear, specific prompts
    - Review Source Control panel after completions
    - Commit frequently for clean checkpoints
    - Use Plan Mode for complex operations first
    - Configure .gitignore to protect sensitive files
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Skip Permission Mode">
    Skip Permission Mode bypasses all permission prompts, allowing complete autonomy. **Only use in isolated, disposable environments.**

    **All Operations Automatic:**
    - File operations
    - Command execution
    - Package installation
    - System-level operations

    <Warning>
    This mode removes all safety guardrails. Only use in completely isolated, disposable environments where mistakes have no consequences. Never use in production or any codebase you care about.
    </Warning>

    #### When to Use

    | Use Skip Permission For | NEVER Use For |
    |------------------------|---------------|
    | Automated CI/CD pipelines in isolated containers | Production environments |
    | Disposable development containers (deleted after experimentation) | Development environments with important code |
    | Sandbox environments with no production connections | Any codebase you care about |
    | Scripted workflows where human approval defeats purpose | Shared repositories |
    | | Environments with sensitive data |

    #### Activation

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Open Permission Menu">
        Click "Switch Permission" button
      </Step>
      <Step title="Select Skip Permission Mode">
        Choose "Skip Permission Mode" from the dropdown
      </Step>
      <Step title="Verify Activation">
        Button displays "Skip" to confirm mode is active
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    **Safety Check Before Activating:**
    - Is this a disposable container or VM?
    - Can this environment be deleted without consequences?
    - Is there any production or important code here?

    If "no" to first two or "yes" to third, do NOT activate.

    #### Safety Warnings

    **ALL safety guardrails removed:**
    - Commands execute immediately with system permissions
    - Files can be modified or deleted without warning
    - Database operations, Git operations (including force push) proceed without approval
    - Could install malicious packages or expose credentials

    **Only Safe When:**
    - Environment is completely disposable
    - No important code or data exists
    - No connection to production systems
    - You accept anything can be destroyed
  </Tab>

## Plan Mode

Plan Mode is a read-only interaction mode where Verdent analyzes code, creates detailed plans, and asks clarifying questions, but cannot modify files or execute commands until you approve.

#### How It Works

1. **Analysis** - Reads files automatically
2. **Planning** - Creates structured plan with todo list
3. **Clarification** - Asks questions to remove uncertainty
4. **Approval** - You review and decide to proceed
5. **Execution** - Switches to your permission mode to execute

Plan shows files to modify, implementation steps, dependencies, and verification strategy.

#### When to Use

- Complex multi-file changes (understand scope before committing)
- Unfamiliar codebases (safe exploration without risk)
- Architectural decisions (review approach before implementation)
- Avoiding Manual Accept fatigue (review once vs 50 individual prompts)
- High-stakes production changes (full visibility before execution)

#### Activation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Mode Menu">
    Click "Switch Mode" button in Input Box
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Plan Mode">
    Choose "Plan Mode" from the dropdown
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Activation">
    Mode indicator changes to "Plan" to confirm mode is active
  </Step>
</Steps>

When active, Verdent analyzes and creates plans but won't modify files or execute commands until you approve. After approval, switches to your default permission mode (Manual Accept or Auto-Run).

#### Safety Considerations

**Advantages:**
- Zero execution risk during planning
- Full visibility before committing
- Interactive clarification removes uncertainty
- Safe for production analysis

**Limitations:**
- Approval doesn't guarantee correctness (plans can have logical errors)
- Execution safety depends on chosen permission mode after approval
- Plan quality depends on prompt clarity

**Best Practices:**
- Review plans for logical errors or misunderstandings
- Ask follow-up questions if unclear
- Refine prompts before approving execution
- Consider which permission mode will execute (Manual Accept for oversight, Auto-Run for speed)

## Think Hard Mode

Think Hard Mode allocates maximum computational resources for complex reasoning tasks. The model explores multiple approaches and provides more thorough solutions.

**Characteristics:**
- Extended reasoning time
- Deeper analysis of multiple solution approaches
- Better handling of complex logic, edge cases, architectural decisions
- Higher credit cost per request

#### When to Use

| Use Think Hard Mode For | Don't Use For |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| Complex architectural decisions with multiple trade-offs | Simple, straightforward tasks |
| Sophisticated debugging with multiple potential causes | Time-sensitive requests |
| Algorithm design requiring optimization analysis | Limited credit budget |
| Critical business logic where correctness is paramount | When standard mode is adequate |
| Performance optimization of complex bottlenecks | |

#### Activation

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Think Hard Button">
    Use the UI button for per-request activation:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Enable Think Hard">
        Click "Think Hard" button/toggle in Input Box
      </Step>
      <Step title="Submit Your Prompt">
        Type and submit your request
      </Step>
      <Step title="Single Request Only">
        Applies to that specific request only - not persistent
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    Works with all AI providers. Not persistent - must activate each time for requests requiring deep reasoning.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Natural Language (Claude)">
    Include thinking keywords in your prompt:

    ```
    Think: Design the optimal database schema for this multi-tenant SaaS application
    ```

    Or for maximum reasoning:

    ```
    Ultrathink: Analyze the trade-offs between different authentication approaches
    ```

    <Note>
    "Think" and "ultrathink" are Claude model-specific capabilities. These keywords activate deeper reasoning in Claude models (Sonnet, Opus) but may not work with other AI providers (GPT-5, MiniMax).
    </Note>

    Per-request activation only - not persistent like Manual Accept or Auto-Run.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Safety Best Practices

<Accordion title="Safety Hierarchy (Most to Least Safe)">
  Understanding the safety ranking of each mode helps you choose appropriately for different risk levels.

  1. **Plan Mode** - Read-only until approved. Zero execution risk during planning.
  2. **Manual Accept Mode** - Per-operation control with first-use approval per tool type.
  3. **Auto-Run Mode** - File autonomy with command approval. Git safety net required.
  4. **Skip Permission Mode** - Full autonomy. Isolated environments only.

  Match your mode to the risk level: critical code uses safest modes (Plan, Manual Accept), trusted code uses faster modes (Auto-Run), disposable environments use fastest mode (Skip Permission).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="General Best Practices">
  Essential practices that apply regardless of which execution mode you're using.

  **For All Modes:**

  1. **Use Version Control** - Initialize Git before using permissive modes, commit frequently, review diffs before committing
  2. **Write Clear Prompts** - Be specific about scope, specify file boundaries explicitly, use @-mentions for context
  3. **Review Before Committing** - Check Source Control panel after completions, review all diffs carefully, test changes
  4. **Start Fresh Sessions** - Clear context between major tasks, reset tool approvals for sensitive work, avoid context contamination
  5. **Match Mode to Risk** - Critical code → Manual Accept or Plan Mode, trusted code → Auto-Run, experiments → Auto-Run with Git, disposable → Skip Permission only

  **Security Reminders:**
  - Never commit sensitive files (.env, credentials)
  - Configure .gitignore before using Auto-Run
  - Review command permissions carefully
  - Use Plan Mode for changes affecting security
  - Fresh sessions reset tool approvals in Manual Accept
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Progressive Permission Model">
  Understanding how Verdent's permission system works helps you use it effectively.

  **How it works:**
  1. **First use** - System requests permission when you first use each tool type (file edits, command executions, tool usage)
  2. **Subsequent uses** - After initial approval, that tool type proceeds without prompts for the rest of the session
  3. **New session** - Starting a new session resets all approvals, allowing you to start fresh

  **Key principle:** This model balances security with productivity. You review and approve tool types once, then work efficiently within that approval context. For sensitive work, start a new session to reset approvals.

  **To reset approvals:** Start a new session
