## Exploring Unfamiliar Codebases

When you ask questions about codebase structure or request file searches, Verdent automatically delegates to the **Explorer subagent** (`@Explorer`), a token-efficient specialist optimized for fast codebase exploration.

The Explorer subagent quickly:
- Finds files matching patterns or names
- Searches code for specific keywords or functions
- Answers architectural questions about the codebase
- Identifies where functionality is implemented

**Example Exploration Questions:**

```
What is the structure of this project?
```

```
Where is user authentication handled?
```

```
Find all API endpoint definitions
```

```
Show me where database queries are defined
```

The Explorer works efficiently in the background, providing fast answers without consuming your main context window. Verdent presents findings with relevant file paths and code snippets.

**Parallel Exploration for Complex Tasks:**

For complex exploration tasks, multiple Explorer agents can run in parallel to save time, each investigating different aspects of the codebase simultaneously. Verdent then synthesizes the findings into a coherent summary.

**Example:**

```
Use the Explorer agent to find all places where we manually validate email addresses
```

This ensures Verdent discovers every location systematically without missing instances across the codebase.

## Generating Documentation

Verdent generates documentation in multiple formats including inline code comments (JSDoc, Python docstrings, etc.), README files, API documentation, and architecture guides.

#### Using Plan Mode for Documentation

In Plan Mode, Verdent can:
- Analyze your existing documentation to match its style and density
- Ask clarifying questions about formatting preferences (comment style, detail level, examples inclusion)
- Analyze the codebase to understand current documentation patterns
- Present a documentation plan showing what will be documented and in what style

**Example:**

```
Generate JSDoc comments for all functions in the utils folder
```

Verdent examines existing JSDoc comments in your project, asks questions about preferences (parameter descriptions, example usage inclusion), then generates documentation matching your established conventions.

**Supported Documentation Formats:**

- **Inline Comments**: JSDoc, Python docstrings, Javadoc, XML documentation comments
- **README Files**: Project overviews, setup instructions, usage guides
- **API Documentation**: Endpoint descriptions, request/response formats, authentication details
- **Architecture Guides**: System design explanations, component relationships, data flow diagrams

<Tip>
  Use Plan Mode when generating extensive documentation. Verdent will review your existing documentation style and ask clarifying questions to ensure generated docs match your project's conventions.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Use Plan Mode when generating documentation for multiple files, review the documentation structure before committing.

## Understanding Architecture

Verdent explains architecture through detailed text descriptions, component relationships, and data flow explanations. While it doesn't generate graphical diagrams directly, it can create ASCII art diagrams or Mermaid diagram code that you can render.

**Example:**

```
Explain the architecture of this application and show component relationships
```

Verdent might produce an ASCII representation:

```
Frontend (React)
    ↓
API Layer (Express)
    ↓
Service Layer (Business Logic)
    ↓
Database Layer (PostgreSQL)
```

Or generate Mermaid code for rendering:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[React Frontend] --> B[API Gateway]
    B --> C[Auth Service]
    B --> D[User Service]
    C --> E[Database]
    D --> E
```

**Architecture Explanations Include:**

- **Component Interactions**: How different parts of the system communicate
- **Data Flow**: How information moves through the application
- **Architectural Patterns**: MVC, microservices, layered architecture, etc.
- **Technology Stack**: Frontend, backend, database, external services
- **Integration Points**: APIs, message queues, webhooks, third-party services
- **Scalability Patterns**: Load balancing, caching, database sharding

Verdent analyzes your project structure, traces imports and dependencies, identifies patterns, and explains the architectural decisions behind your system design.

## Onboarding New Team Members

Verdent helps onboard new team members by answering questions about the codebase, explaining architectural decisions, identifying key files and patterns, and generating documentation tailored to help newcomers understand the project structure and conventions.

**In Plan Mode**, Verdent can ask clarifying questions to understand what aspects of the codebase are most relevant to the new team member's role before creating a personalized onboarding guide.

**Example Onboarding Questions:**

```
What's the best starting point for understanding this codebase?
```

```
How does data flow from the API to the frontend?
```

```
Where should I look to understand the authentication system?
```

```
What are the naming conventions and code style guidelines used here?
```

**Verdent Can Generate:**

- **Onboarding Guides**: Step-by-step walkthroughs of the codebase architecture
- **Component Maps**: Visual or text-based guides showing how components relate
- **Common Patterns**: Documentation of frequently used patterns and conventions
- **Setup Instructions**: How to configure development environment and run the project
- **First Tasks**: Suggestions for simple first contributions to gain familiarity

New team members can explore the codebase conversationally, getting immediate answers without needing to interrupt senior developers or spend hours reading through code.

<Note>
  Verdent's Explorer subagent makes codebase discovery efficient for newcomers. They can ask broad questions like "Show me all React components" or specific queries like "Where is error logging implemented?" and get immediate, accurate answers.
</Note>

## Best Practices

<Accordion title="Start with broad questions, then drill down">
  Begin with high-level questions like "What is the architecture?" before diving into specific implementations. This builds context progressively.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use the Explorer subagent explicitly for comprehensive searches">
  For thorough searches across the codebase, explicitly mention the Explorer agent to ensure no instances are missed: "Use Explorer to find all authentication checks."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Ask 'why' questions, not just 'what'">
  Understanding the rationale behind decisions is often more valuable than understanding the implementation. Ask "Why was this pattern chosen?" alongside "What does this code do?"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Leverage Plan Mode for documentation generation">
  When generating docs, use Plan Mode to review Verdent's approach, ensure it matches your style, and refine the plan before execution.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use @-mentions for focused explanations">
  Reference specific files when you want detailed explanations: "@components/UserProfile.tsx explain this component" ensures Verdent focuses on the right code.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Build context before requesting changes">
  Before making modifications, ask Verdent to explain the current implementation. This helps Verdent make better suggestions that align with existing patterns.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Ask follow-up questions freely">
  Verdent maintains conversation context, so you can ask clarifying questions, request deeper explanations, or explore related topics without repeating context.
</Accordion>
