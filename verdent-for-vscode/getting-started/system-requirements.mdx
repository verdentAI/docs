Verdent for VS Code is a native Visual Studio Code extension that inherits Visual Studio Code's cross-platform compatibility without requiring separate installations or configurations for different operating systems.

---

## Supported Operating Systems

Verdent for VS Code supports all operating systems where Visual Studio Code is available:

| Operating System | Supported Versions | Architecture |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **macOS** | macOS 11 (Big Sur) and later | Intel and Apple Silicon |
| **Windows** | Windows 10 (version 1607+), Windows 11, Windows Server 2016+ | 64-bit only |
| **Linux** | Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 10+, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8+, Fedora, CentOS 8+, openSUSE Leap 15.2+ | x64 and ARM64 |

<Note>
  **Deprecated platforms**: macOS 10.15 (Catalina) support ended with Visual Studio Code 1.98 (February 2025). Windows 7 and 8/8.1 are no longer supported as of Visual Studio Code 1.70 (July 2022). Windows 32-bit systems are no longer supported as of Visual Studio Code 1.83 (September 2023).
</Note>

### Linux Requirements

For Linux systems, ensure your distribution meets these requirements:

* **glibc 2.28 or later** (as of Visual Studio Code 1.86.1, January 2024)
* **GLIBCXX version 3.4.25 or later**

---

## IDE/Editor Versions Required

**Visual Studio Code:**
* Version **1.90.0 or higher** required
* Latest stable version recommended for best compatibility

Verdent for VS Code works with Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio Code-based editors (Cursor, VSCodium). It does not support editors such as JetBrains IDEs, Sublime Text, or Vim.

## Hardware Requirements

### Minimum Requirements

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **RAM** | 1 GB (4 GB+ recommended for larger projects) |
| **Disk Space** | < 500 MB for Visual Studio Code + Verdent extension |
| **CPU** | Any processor capable of running Visual Studio Code |

### Recommended Specifications

For optimal performance, especially when working with large codebases or multi-agent workflows:

* **RAM**: 8 GB or more
* **CPU**: Multi-core processor for concurrent subagent execution
* **Disk Space**: 1 GB+ for caching and indexing (if enabled)

<Tip>
  Performance scales with hardware capabilities. Multi-agent workflows and large-scale refactoring benefit from additional RAM and processing power.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Recommended specifications are general guidelines. Official hardware recommendations for Verdent-specific features (multi-agent workflows, caching, indexing) are pending from the Verdent team.
</Warning>

## Network Requirements

Verdent for VS Code requires an **active internet connection at all times** to function.

### Connectivity Requirements

* **Connection Type**: Stable broadband internet connection
* **Protocol**: Outbound HTTPS connections to Verdent's API endpoints
* **Bandwidth**: Sufficient for code context transmission and AI response streaming

### Firewall & Proxy Considerations

For corporate environments or users behind firewalls:

**Required Access:**
* Outbound HTTPS traffic to Verdent's API domains
* Verdent handles routing to multiple model providers (Claude, GPT-5, Gemini, MiniMax, etc.)
* No inbound firewall rules or port forwarding needed

**Enterprise Setup:**
* Corporate firewalls must allow outbound HTTPS to Verdent service endpoints
* Proxy servers should pass through API requests
* SSL/TLS inspection may require exceptions for Verdent endpoints

<Warning>
  Without internet connectivity, Verdent for VS Code cannot process requests or provide any AI-assisted functionality. The extension will not work offline.
</Warning>

## FAQs

<Accordion title="How do I check my Visual Studio Code version?">
Open Visual Studio Code and go to **Help** → **About** (or **Code** → **About Visual Studio Code** on macOS). The version number is displayed in the dialog. Verdent requires Visual Studio Code version 1.90.0 or higher.

You can also check via command line:
```bash
code --version
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I verify my Linux system meets the requirements?">
Check your glibc and GLIBCXX versions using these commands:

```bash
# Check glibc version (need 2.28 or later)
ldd --version

# Check GLIBCXX version (need 3.4.25 or later)
strings /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6 | grep GLIBCXX
```

If your distribution doesn't meet these requirements, you may need to upgrade to a newer version of your Linux distribution.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I troubleshoot firewall or connection issues?">
If Verdent cannot connect to AI services, check these common issues:

**Test basic connectivity:**
- Verify you have active internet access
- Try accessing other HTTPS services to confirm outbound connections work

**Corporate/Enterprise environments:**
- Contact your network administrator to whitelist Verdent's API endpoints
- Ensure outbound HTTPS traffic is allowed through your firewall
- Check if proxy servers are properly configured to pass through API requests
- SSL/TLS inspection may need exceptions for Verdent endpoints

**Common symptoms:**
- Extension appears to hang or timeout
- Authentication failures despite correct credentials

If issues persist after firewall configuration, contact Verdent support for specific endpoint details to whitelist.
