## Verifying Installation

Confirm your installation is working correctly with these simple checks:

### Visual Verification

1. **Sidebar Icon** - Look for the Verdent icon in the VS Code sidebar (left side)
2. **Extension List** - Open Extensions panel (`Cmd+Shift+X` / `Ctrl+Shift+X`) and confirm "Verdent" shows as installed with a checkmark

### Functional Verification

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Verdent Panel">
    Click the Verdent icon in the sidebar or press `Cmd+L` (macOS) / `Ctrl+L` (Windows/Linux).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send Test Prompt">
    Try a simple request like "Explain what this workspace contains" in the input box.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Receive Response">
    Verdent should analyze your workspace and provide a response within seconds.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Success Indicators:**

* Verdent icon visible in sidebar
* Successfully authenticated account
* Can send prompts and receive responses

### Troubleshooting

If verification fails, try these solutions:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Sidebar icon missing | Restart VS Code or check for extension updates |
| Prompts don't respond | Check internet connection and firewall settings |
| Extension not found | Ensure VS Code version is 1.90.0 or higher |

<Warning>
  Verdent requires an active internet connection. If prompts aren't responding, verify your network connectivity and firewall configuration allows outbound HTTPS to Verdent's API endpoints.
</Warning>
