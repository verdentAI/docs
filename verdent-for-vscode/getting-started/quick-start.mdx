## Step 3: Your First Task

Let's start with a simple, non-destructive task that demonstrates Verdent's understanding of your workspace.

**Open a project in VS Code**, then try one of these prompts in the Verdent input box:

```
What kind of project is this?
```

Verdent will analyze your workspace structure, read key files, and explain what type of application you're working on. This demonstrates context awareness without making any changes.

**You should see:**

- Verdent analyzing files in your workspace
- A summary of your project type, technologies, and structure
- No file modifications (read-only analysis)

**Try these follow-up prompts:**

```
Explain what this project does
```

```
What dependencies does this project have?
```

```
Show me the main entry point of this application
```

Each prompt helps you verify that Verdent can access your workspace and understands your codebase.

<Tip>
  These exploratory prompts are perfect for understanding unfamiliar codebases. Verdent reads files as needed without requiring you to manually add context.
</Tip>

---

## Step 4: Making Your First Code Change

Now let's make Verdent create something. Try this simple task:

```
Create a hello_world.txt file with a greeting message
```

**What happens:**

1. **Verdent proposes the change**You'll see a preview showing the file to be created and its contents
2. **Permission request**  In Auto Run Mode (the default), Verdent will auto-approval  when creating the file
3. **You approveL** Click "Accept" or approve the change
4. **File created**Verdent creates the file and confirms completion

**Understanding permissions:**

Manual Accept Mode ensures no unwanted modifications occur without your approval. You'll see permission prompts for:

- File edits and creations
- Command executions
- Tool usage (first use of each tool type)

This gives you full control and helps you learn what operations Verdent performs for different tasks.

<Note>
  Manual Accept Mode is the recommended starting point for new users. Once comfortable, you can switch to Auto-Run Mode or Plan Mode for different workflows.
</Note>

---

## Step 5: Using Plan Mode for Complex Tasks

Plan Mode is Verdent's read-only planning mode where you can review approaches before execution. Let's try it:

**Switch to Plan Mode:**

Click the **Switch Mode** button in the input box and select **Plan Mode**

**Try a planning task:**

```
Suggest ways to build a website for my project
```

**What happens:**

1. **Verdent analyzes your project**It reads files and understands your project structure and requirements
2. **Creates a detailed plan**Shows what technologies to use, what pages to create, and how to structure the website
3. **No modifications**Plan Mode is read-only. Verdent cannot modify files until you explicitly approve
4. **Interactive clarification**Verdent may ask questions about design preferences, target audience, or features before finalizing the plan

**Why use Plan Mode:**

- **Safe exploration** - Understand unfamiliar codebases without accidental changes
- **Code review** - Analyze quality and architecture before making modifications
- **Strategic planning** - Break down complex tasks into reviewable steps
- **Uncertainty reduction** - Verdent asks clarifying questions to remove ambiguity

<Tip>
  Use Plan Mode for any task where you want to review the approach before committing to execution. It's particularly valuable when learning how Verdent thinks about your codebase.
</Tip>

**To execute the plan:**

After reviewing the plan, Verdent presents two options:

- Choose **Edit** to request modifications or ask clarifying questions
- Choose **Start Building** to switch to Agent Mode and begin execution

## Step 6: Understanding Execution Modes

Verdent offers multiple execution modes to match different workflows:

**Permission Modes:**

| Mode                  | Description                                                                                                      | When to Use                                                     |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Manual Accept**     | Requests permission on first use of each tool                                                                    | Learning and general development with maximum control           |
| **Auto-Run**(default) | Automatically accepts safe operations (file reads, web searches); file edits and commands still require approval | Trusted projects and rapid prototyping                          |
| **Plan Mode**         | Read-only mode for analysis and planning without file modifications                                              | Complex tasks and code review                                   |
| **Skip Permissions**  | Fully autonomous operation bypassing all prompts                                                                 | Isolated, safe environments like automated testing or sandboxes |

**Additional Mode:**

- **Think Hard Mode** - Maximum thinking budget for complex reasoning and architectural decisions

<Warning>
  Skip Permissions Mode removes all safety checks. Only use in isolated, disposable environments where mistakes have no consequences.
</Warning>

## Pro Tips for Beginners

<Accordion title="Start with exploratory prompts">
  Before making changes, let Verdent understand your codebase:

  ```
  Analyze the database schema
  ```

  ```
  Explain the authentication flow
  ```

  This builds Verdent's context about your project and helps it make better suggestions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Be specific with your requests">
  Instead of: "fix the bug"

  Try: "fix the login bug in `LoginForm.tsx` where users see a blank screen after entering wrong credentials"

  Specific prompts lead to more accurate solutions and fewer iterations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use Plan Mode for unfamiliar code">
  When working with code you don't fully understand, use Plan Mode first:

  ```
  Refactor the authentication module to use async/await instead of callbacks
  ```

  Review the plan, choose **Edit** to ask clarifying questions and refine, then choose **Start Building** once confident.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Break complex tasks into steps">
  For multi-step features, work incrementally:

  ```
  1. Create a new database table for user profiles
  ```

  Then after completion:

  ```
  2. Create an API endpoint to get and update profiles
  ```

  This maintains clarity and allows you to verify each step.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Leverage @-mentions for context">
  Explicitly reference files when needed:

  ```
  @components/UserProfile.tsx refactor this component to use hooks
  ```

  This ensures Verdent focuses on the right context for your task.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use subagents for specialized tasks">
  Verdent includes three built-in subagents:

  - `@Explorer` - Fast codebase exploration and file discovery
  - `@Verifier` - Quick code validation and checks
  - `@Code-reviewer` - Comprehensive security and quality review

  Example:

  ```
  @Explorer find all API endpoints in this project
  ```
</Accordion>
