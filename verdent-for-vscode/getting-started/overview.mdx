## What is Verdent?

Verdent for Visual Studio Code is an AI coding assistant built for professional software projects. Traditional AI coding tools guess your intent. Verdent lets you plan exactly what to build, verify it works correctly, and deliver reliable code every time.

**Plan-Code-Verify Workflow:**

- **Plan** - Clarify requirements and design solutions with clear, visual logic diagrams
- **Code** - Review, refactor, and improve your code with Code Diff, delivering clear results every time
- **Verify** - Catch issues early with dedicated verifier subagents and browser tools

The extension uses specialized subagents to handle different workflow phases. Each subagent operates with isolated context to maintain peak performance and prevent context pollution. The extension learns your coding habits and project patterns, enabling custom workflows and specialized subagent deployment.

**Key capabilities:**

- **Build features from descriptions**: Tell Verdent what you want to build in plain English in Plan mode and set your plan rules. It will make a professional plan, write the code, and ensure it works through comprehensive verification
- **Code-Verify loop for reliability results**:  Review, refactor, and improve your code with ease, and deliver clear results every time. Multi-modal inputs ensure implementation matches exact requirements. Automate test interactions and catch issues early with a verifier subagent and browser tools. Validation happens continuously throughout development.
- **Debug and fix issues**: Describe a bug or paste an error message. Verdent will analyze your codebase, identify the problem, and implement a fix with multipass testing
- **Navigate and refactor any codebase**: Ask anything about your codebase and get thoughtful answers. Perform safe refactoring across multiple files while preserving functionality

## Why Developers Choose Verdent

- **Multi-Provider Intelligence**: Unlike competitors locked to a single AI provider, Verdent orchestrates models from different providers (Claude, GPT-5, Gemini, Kimi) within a single workflow. Each specialized agent leverages the optimal model for its specific task.
- **Plan-Code-Verify Workflow**: Plan precisely what to build, verify it works correctly before delivery, and code with confidence. Verdent asks clarifying questions, creates structured plans, automates verification, and ensures alignment before making changes. After generating a plan, choose **Edit** to refine or **Start Building** to execute.
- \*\*Professional Plan Mode: \*\*In Plan mode, Verdent can transform informal ideas into production-ready implementation plans through structured requirement clarification, plan rules and visual design. Collaborative dialogue and iterative refinement ensure alignment before implementation begins.
- **Native Visual Studio Code Integration**: Works seamlessly within your existing workflow with minimal disruption. No need to learn new tools or restructure your development process.

## FAQs

<Accordion title="What is Visual Studio Code?">
  Visual Studio Code is a free, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. It's a lightweight but powerful development environment that supports multiple programming languages and offers features like debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, and integrated version control. Verdent integrates directly into Visual Studio Code as an extension, adding AI-powered coding capabilities to your existing workflow.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is Plan Mode?">
  Plan Mode is a read-only execution mode where Verdent analyzes code, conducts research, and creates detailed implementation plans without modifying files or executing commands. After generating a plan, Verdent presents two options: **Edit** (to request modifications and refine the plan) or **Start Building** (to switch to Agent Mode and begin execution). The agent can ask clarifying questions to remove uncertainty before execution. This mode is ideal for complex tasks where you want to review the approach before committing to changes, ensuring alignment between your expectations and Verdent's proposed solution.
