## What is Verdent?

Verdent for Visual Studio Code is an AI coding assistant built for professional software projects. It integrates autonomous planning, coding, and verification directly into your existing Visual Studio Code workflow.

The extension uses specialized subagents to handle different tasks. Features include Plan Mode for reviewing approaches before making changes, context-aware suggestions that learn from your coding style, and the ability to handle multiple tasks concurrently.

Code verification uses dedicated subagents that run comprehensive tests through iterative testing cycles until acceptance. Each iteration produces detailed summaries with code diffs showing exactly what changed and whether it passed verification. The extension learns your coding habits and project patterns, enabling custom workflows and specialized subagent deployment.

**Key capabilities:**

* **Build features from descriptions**: Tell Verdent what you want to build in plain English. It will make a plan, write the code, and ensure it works through comprehensive verification.
* **Debug and fix issues**: Describe a bug or paste an error message. Verdent will analyze your codebase, identify the problem, and implement a fix with multipass testing.
* **Navigate and refactor any codebase**: Ask anything about your codebase and get thoughtful answers. Perform safe refactoring across multiple files while preserving functionality.
* **Automate testing and verification**: Generate comprehensive unit and integration tests, verify code quality through iterative cycles, and ensure production readiness before delivery.

## Why Developers Choose Verdent

* **Multi-Provider Intelligence**: Unlike competitors locked to a single AI provider, Verdent orchestrates models from different providers (Claude, GPT-5, Gemini, MiniMax) within a single workflow. Each specialized agent leverages the optimal model for its specific task.
* **Plan-First Workflows**: Review detailed implementation plans before execution. Verdent asks clarifying questions and creates structured approaches. After generating a plan, choose **Edit** to refine or **Start Building** to execute, ensuring alignment before making changes.
* **Production-Ready Verification**: Iterative testing cycles ensure code passes comprehensive testing before delivery. Verdent automatically generates, tests, and repairs code until it works correctly. Each result includes detailed summaries with interactive code diffs and verification results.
* **Native Visual Studio Code Integration**: Works seamlessly within your existing workflow with minimal disruption. No need to learn new tools or restructure your development process.

## FAQs

<Accordion title="What is Visual Studio Code?">
  Visual Studio Code is a free, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. It's a lightweight but powerful development environment that supports multiple programming languages and offers features like debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, and integrated version control. Verdent integrates directly into Visual Studio Code as an extension, adding AI-powered coding capabilities to your existing workflow.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is Plan Mode?">
  Plan Mode is a read-only execution mode where Verdent analyzes code, conducts research, and creates detailed implementation plans without modifying files or executing commands. After generating a plan, Verdent presents two options: **Edit** (to request modifications and refine the plan) or **Start Building** (to switch to Agent Mode and begin execution). The agent can ask clarifying questions to remove uncertainty before execution. This mode is ideal for complex tasks where you want to review the approach before committing to changes, ensuring alignment between your expectations and Verdent's proposed solution.
