### What You'll Learn

Known limitations of Verdent for VS Code, including file format restrictions, tool constraints, and platform-specific considerations.

---

## Known Limitations

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="File Formats">
    ### Binary Files Not Supported

    Verdent's file tools only work with text-based formats. The following cannot be edited:

    | Format Type       | Examples                       |
    | ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
    | **Images**        | PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG (as binary) |
    | **Videos**        | MP4, AVI, MOV                  |
    | **Compiled Code** | EXE, DLL, SO                   |
    | **Archives**      | ZIP, TAR, GZ                   |
    | **Office Docs**   | DOCX, XLSX, PPTX               |
    | **PDFs**          | PDF files                      |

    **Workaround:** Binary files can be referenced in code or discussed conceptually, but modifications require external tools.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Tool Constraints">
    ### file_read Line Limits

    **Limitation:**

    - Large files (\>10,000 lines) should be read in sections
    - Reading entire large files may cause context exhaustion

    **Solution:** Use line ranges: `file_read("file.js", start_line=100, max_lines=50)`

    ---

    ### bash Command Timeouts

    **Limitation:**

    - Maximum timeout: 120 seconds (2 minutes)
    - Long-running operations will be automatically terminated

    **Solution:** Break operations into smaller commands that complete within 2 minutes

    ---

    ### Search Performance

    **Limitation:**

    - Broad glob patterns (`**/*`) can return thousands of results
    - Regex searches slower than literal strings

    **Solution:** Use specific patterns and exclude unnecessary directories
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Context Window">
    ### Context Exhaustion

    **Issue:**During long sessions or complex operations, the AI's context window can fill up, limiting the ability to reference earlier conversation.

    **Mitigation Strategies:**

    - Use subagents for exploratory research (results only consume main context)
    - Read files strategically with line ranges
    - Use `grep_file` before reading full contents
    - Delegate background tasks to Explorer subagent

    <Tip>
      For files over 500 lines, always use line ranges to preserve context space.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>

## What Verdent Cannot Do

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="System Administration">
    ### No Direct System Administration

    **Cannot:**

    - Modify VS Code settings programmatically
    - Install VS Code extensions automatically
    - Change system-level configurations
    - Restart VS Code or system services

    **Scope:** Verdent operates within the VS Code workspace, not at the system administration level.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Autonomous Execution">
    ### No Autonomous Execution

    **Manual Accept Mode Controls:**

    - Users must approve tool executions in Manual Accept Mode
    - No automated background operations without approval
    - Cannot run commands while VS Code is closed

    **Purpose:** Safety and user control over all operations.

    <Warning>
      Verdent cannot execute commands in the background without user approval. All operations require explicit consent in Manual Accept Mode.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Real-Time Monitoring">
    ### No Real-Time Monitoring

    **Cannot:**

    - Monitor running processes continuously
    - Track file system changes in real-time
    - Alert on system events
    - Stream log files continuously

    **Alternative:** Use MCP integrations for external monitoring tools.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Network Operations">
    ### No Network Operations Without MCP

    **Built-in Limitations:**

    - Cannot make arbitrary HTTP requests (use `web_fetch` for specific pages)
    - No direct database connections (requires MCP)
    - Cannot access cloud services directly (requires MCP)
    - No real-time API integrations (requires MCP)

    **Solution:** Configure MCP servers for external system access.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Platform-Specific Restrictions

### Operating System Differences

**bash Tool Behavior:**

| Platform        | Shell      | Notes                                                      |
| --------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **macOS/Linux** | bash/zsh   | Full bash functionality                                    |
| **Windows**     | PowerShell | Some bash commands unavailable, use PowerShell equivalents |
| **WSL**         | bash       | Linux commands work in WSL environment                     |

**Path Handling:**

- Windows uses backslashes (`\`), Unix uses forward slashes (`/`)
- File paths may need adjustment for cross-platform projects

---

### VS Code Version Requirements

**Minimum Requirements:**

- VS Code version compatibility (check extension marketplace for current minimum)
- Node.js 18+ for certain operations
- Sufficient disk space for context caching

<Info>
  Specific version requirements are maintained in the VS Code marketplace listing. Check extension details for current compatibility.
</Info>

---

### Workspace Constraints

**Single Workspace Focus:**

- Verdent operates within one VS Code workspace at a time
- Cannot simultaneously modify files across multiple open VS Code windows
- Multi-root workspaces supported but context limited to current active workspace

---

## Workarounds for Common Limitations

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Binary Files">
    ### Binary File Modification

    **Limitation:** Cannot edit images, PDFs, or compiled binaries

    **Workarounds:**

    - Reference external tools in bash commands: `bash("convert input.png -resize 50% output.png")`
    - Generate scripts that external tools can execute
    - Document manual steps for binary file operations

    **Example:**

    ```bash
    # Image conversion
    bash("convert input.png -resize 50% output.png")
    
    # PDF to text
    bash("pdftotext document.pdf output.txt")
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Large Files">
    ### Large File Handling

    **Limitation:** Files over 10,000 lines strain the context window

    **Workarounds:**

    - Use line ranges: `file_read("large.log", start_line=1000, max_lines=100)`
    - Search first: `grep_content("ERROR", glob="large.log")` to find relevant sections
    - Break files into smaller modules for easier management

    <Tip>
      Always use `grep_content` first to identify relevant sections, then read only those specific line ranges.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Context Window">
    ### Context Window Exhaustion

    **Limitation:** Long conversations fill the context window

    **Workarounds:**

    - Delegate to Explorer subagent for codebase research
    - Use Verifier subagent for isolated validation tasks
    - Start new conversation for distinct tasks
    - Use `todo_update` to track progress across sessions

    **Best Practice:** Delegate background research to subagents to preserve main context for active development.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Platform Differences">
    ### Platform Command Differences

    **Limitation:** bash commands differ between Windows and Unix

    **Workarounds:**

    - Use cross-platform tools: npm scripts instead of raw bash
    - Conditional commands: `bash("if [[ \"$OSTYPE\" == \"linux-gnu\"* ]]; then ...; fi")`
    - Project-specific AGENTS.md with platform notes

    **Example:**

    ```bash
    # Cross-platform
    bash("npm run build")
    
    # Platform-specific conditional
    bash("if [[ \"$OSTYPE\" == \"linux-gnu\"* ]]; then make; else nmake; fi")
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
