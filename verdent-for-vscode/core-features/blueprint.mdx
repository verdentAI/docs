description: "Transform ideas into production-ready implementation plans with intelligent requirement clarification"
---

In Plan mode, Verdent can transform informal ideas into production-ready implementation plans through structured requirement clarification and visual design. Collaborative dialogue and iterative refinement ensure alignment before implementation begins.

### What You'll Learn

- Intelligent requirement clarification
- Professional blueprint generation
- Inline editing and iterative refinement
- Blueprint persistence and reusability

---

## Intelligent Requirement Clarification

Verdent engages as a technical partner:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Exploratory Dialogue">
    Multi-turn conversations to uncover implicit requirements:

    - Edge case identification and technical constraint discovery
    - Proactive ambiguity resolution before implementation
    - Iterative refinement through collaborative discussion
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Domain Expertise">
    Applies software engineering best practices:

    - Suggests optimal approaches, design patterns, and technology choices
    - Presents trade-off analysis with pros/cons for informed decision-making
    - Recommends industry-standard solutions and frameworks
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Convenient interaction">

## Professional Blueprint Generation

Comprehensive, developer-ready blueprints include:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Requirement Overview">
    High-level summary of goals, scope, and success criteria to establish project direction.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Task Breakdown">
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Technical Design">
    Detailed specification including:

    - System architecture diagrams
    - Component structure and relationships
    - Data models and API contracts
    - UI/UX specifications with visual mockups
    - Technology stack justification
  </Step>
  <Step title="Task Breakdown">
    Hierarchical list with dependencies and priorities to organize implementation workflow.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Format:**

- Rich, interactive documents with collapsible sections
- Embedded diagrams (sequence diagrams, architecture diagrams, flowcharts)
- Code snippets and pseudocode for critical logic
- Links to relevant documentation and resources

---

## Inline Editing and Iterative Refinement

- Modifying the plan either manually or through the AI.
- Zoom in, zoom out, or download the flowcharts and sequence diagrams within the plan.
- Review change history to understand requirement evolution.

---

## Persistence and Reusability

- **Local Storage** - Save blueprints as markdown files for version control
- **Modular Composition** - Reference and combine blueprints across projects
- **Template Library** - Build reusable patterns for common scenarios (CRUD, API integrations, UI components)
