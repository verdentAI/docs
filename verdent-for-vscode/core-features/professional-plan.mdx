In Plan mode, Verdent can transform informal ideas into production-ready implementation plans through structured requirement clarification and visual design. Collaborative dialogue and iterative refinement ensure alignment before implementation begins.

### What You'll Learn

- Intelligent requirement clarification
- Professional Plan generation
- Comprehensive Plan Management and Interaction
- Plan persistence and reusability

## Intelligent Requirement Clarification

Verdent engages as a technical partner:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Exploratory Dialogue">
    Multi-turn conversations to uncover implicit requirements:

    - Edge case identification and technical constraint discovery
    - Proactive ambiguity resolution before implementation
    - Iterative refinement through collaborative discussion
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Domain Expertise">
    Applies software engineering best practices:

    - Suggests optimal approaches, design patterns, and technology choices
    - Presents trade-off analysis with pros/cons for informed decision-making
    - Recommends industry-standard solutions and frameworks
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Convenient interaction">
    Supports convenient clarification interactions：

    - Modifying clarification options
    - Additional information and context
    - Skipping clarifications
    - Rolling back changes and resubmit
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Professional Professional Plan Generation

Comprehensive, developer-ready Plan include:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Plan Rules">
    - Built-in role templates (Frontend, Test, Product Manager)
    - Creating custom plan rules that match your thinking style and work habits
  </Step>
  <Step title="Plan Preview">
    High-level summary of goals, scope, and success criteria to establish project direction

    - Clarify the structure and content of the plan through plan review
    - After aligning with the AI during the plan review, click ‘Generate Plan’ to create the detailed plan content.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Plan Design">
    Detailed specification including:

    - System architecture diagrams
    - Component structure and relationships
    - Data models and API contracts
    - UI/UX specifications with visual mockups
    - Technology stack justification
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Format:**

- Rich, interactive documents with collapsible sections
- Embedded diagrams (sequence diagrams, architecture diagrams, flowcharts)
- Code snippets and pseudocode for critical logic
- Links to relevant documentation and resources

---

## Comprehensive Plan Management and Interaction

- View plan content and diagrams either within the conversation flow or in an expanded window
- Modify the plan either manually or through the AI
- Zoom in, zoom out, or download the flowcharts and sequence diagrams within the plan
- Review the change history to understand requirement evolution

---

## Persistence and Reusability

- **Local Storage** - Save Plan as markdown files for version control
- **Modular Composition** - Reference and combine Plan across projects
- **Template Library** - Build reusable patterns for common scenarios (CRUD, API integrations, UI components)
