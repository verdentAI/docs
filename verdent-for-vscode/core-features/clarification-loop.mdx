title: Clarification Loop
description: Smarter planning through continuous discussion and refinement of requirements
---

In Plan Mode, AI asks clarifying questions through an interactive questionnaire, allowing collaborative requirement confirmation before implementation.

### What You'll Learn

- Interactive questionnaire system with multiple choice answers
- File attachment support for contextual answers
- Continuous refinement controls (regenerate, modify, skip, rollback)
- When clarification loops are triggered

## Interactive Questionnaire System

Clarification Loop works like a questionnaire where AI asks clarifying questions and you provide answers:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Answer Options">
    - **Multiple choice** - Select from predefined answer options
    - **Custom answers** - Craft your own answer when choices don't fit
    - **Mixed approach** - Select an option and add custom clarification
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="File Attachments">
    - Attach files to any answer for visual or technical context
    - Upload screenshots, mockups, config files, or reference implementations
    - Enhanced context leads to more accurate plans
    - Supports standard image and document formats

    <Tip>
    Attach UI mockups or design screenshots to clarification answers for accurate visual requirement understanding.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Continuous Refinement Controls

Available interactions during the clarification loop:

- **Regenerate** - Request different clarification questions when current ones don't address your needs
- **Modify Options** - Adjust the multiple choice options presented to better match your context
- **Skip Clarifications** - Proceed with AI's best judgment when requirements are clear enough
- **Rollback Changes** - Revert to previous clarification state and resubmit different answers

## When Clarifications Are Triggered

AI asks clarifying questions when encountering:

- Ambiguous requirements needing specification
- Multiple valid implementation approaches requiring your preference
- Edge cases requiring decisions on handling strategies
- Technical constraints not yet defined (performance, security, compatibility)
- Architecture or technology stack choices

<Tip>
Request clarification loops explicitly in Plan Mode: "Ask me clarifying questions about the requirements before creating the plan"
</Tip>
