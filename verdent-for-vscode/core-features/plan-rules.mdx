Plan Rules supports the **Plan** phase by personalizing how Verdent presents requirements, clarifications, and implementation plans. Use built-in role-based templates as starting points or create fully custom rules that match your thinking style and work habits.

### What You'll Learn

- How Plan Rules customize plan presentation
- Built-in role templates (Frontend, Test, Product Manager)
- Creating custom plan rules
- When plan rules are applied

## What Plan Rules Can Customize

Plan Rules control how Verdent presents plans in Plan Mode:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Presentation Format">
    - **Summary-detail-summary** - Executive summary upfront, detailed steps in middle, impact summary at end
    - **Diagram-first** - Visual representation leads, text provides supporting details
    - **Tabular vs narrative** - Structured tables for scannable data, prose for contextual explanations
    - **Section ordering** - Customize which sections appear first and define hierarchy

    <Tip>
      Use summary-detail-summary for stakeholder reviews where quick comprehension matters. Use diagram-first when architectural understanding is critical before diving into implementation.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Content Depth">
    - **High-level strategic** - Focuses on "what" and "why" with minimal technical details
    - **Detailed technical** - Includes implementation specifics, code patterns, architecture decisions
    - **Code examples** - Control whether code appears (include/exclude, full vs snippets, diff format)
    - **Testing content** - Include by default for QA workflows, omit for PM-focused plans

    <Tip>
      Match content depth to your audience. Use high-level strategic for cross-team collaboration and detailed technical when implementing alone or with senior developers.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Visual Elements">
    - **Mermaid diagrams** - Flowcharts, sequence diagrams, state machines (auto-generated or explicit)
    - **DOM hierarchy trees** - Component structure in tree-style folder format
    - **Wireframes** - UI mockups and layout sketches
    - **Style tables** - CSS specifications with merged cells, organized by component

    <Tip>
      Mermaid diagrams are auto-generated from plan content when requested. Explicitly ask for specific diagram types in your plan rules if you want them by default.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Default Behaviors">
    - **Omit by default** - Testing, styles, backward compatibility (reduces plan length)
    - **Required elements** - Acceptance criteria, edge cases, KPIs (ensures production-readiness)
    - **Clarification preferences** - Multiple rounds vs single confirmation vs no confirmation

    <Tip>
      Start with omissions to keep plans concise, then add required elements only for what you actually need. You can always request omitted content in specific plan sessions.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Role-Specific">
    - **Frontend** - Visual architecture with diagrams, DOM trees, style tables, omits testing by default
    - **QA/Test** - Test case tables with coverage matrices, boundary value analysis, traceability
    - **Product Manager** - Business requirements only, diagrams/wireframes, no code snippets

    <Tip>
      Start with a role template and customize from there. Most developers use Frontend or QA templates as a base and adjust specific sections to match their workflow.

    - Mermaid flowcharts and state diagrams for interaction flows
    - DOM hierarchy in tree-style folder format
    - Style tables with merged cells for CSS properties
    - **Omits:** Testing content and styles by default (unless requested)
    - **Provides:** Definitive solutions without multiple options

    **Best For:** Frontend developers needing visual architecture and clear implementation paths
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Test">
    **Focus:** Comprehensive test case generation and quality assurance

    **Key Characteristics:**

    - Goal-oriented test design (business logic, security, stability)
    - Structured test cases with 9-column Markdown tables
    - Equivalence classes, boundary values, and key parameters
    - Full coverage: normal, alternative, exception, and edge cases
    - Executability focus with automation support
    - Traceability to requirement points

    **Best For:** QA engineers and test automation specialists needing systematic test coverage
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Product Manager (PM)">
    **Focus:** Product requirements from business perspective

    **Key Characteristics:**

    - **No code snippets or technical implementation**
    - Focuses on **what** and **why**, not **how**
    - Sequence diagrams, flowcharts, and wireframes
    - Requirement lists with priorities and Before/After comparisons
    - Edge cases with handling strategies
    - Data specifications with KPIs and event tracking

    **Best For:** Product managers defining business requirements without technical pollution
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Custom Plan Rules

Create personalized plan rules by defining:

**Rule Components:**

- **Presentation Style** - Summary-detail-summary, diagram-first, or tabular format
- **Content Depth** - High-level overview vs detailed implementation
- **Omissions** - What to exclude by default (testing, styles, backward compatibility)
- **Required Elements** - Mandatory sections (diagrams, acceptance criteria, data specs)
- **Interaction Preferences** - Clarification approach, confirmation requirements

<Tip>
  In Plan Mode, click the **Plan Rules** button in the Input Box to quickly access and modify your plan rules.
</Tip>

**Rule Application:**

- Applies to all Plan Mode sessions
- Persists across workspace sessions
- Can be overridden with inline directives
- Works with custom subagents

**Learn More:** Create or edit `Plan.md` in your workspace to define custom plan rules using Markdown format.
