Verdent for VS Code combines advanced AI capabilities with professional development workflows. This guide introduces the core features that enable AI-assisted coding, from requirement engineering through automated quality assurance.

### What You'll Learn

- Core workflow capabilities (Professional Plan, Code Diff, Verify Loop)
- Context awareness and specialized sub-agents
- Collaboration modes and extensibility

---

Verdent's workflow is built around three core phases:

- **Plan** - Clarify requirements with Plan Mode
- **Verify** - Automate testing with Verify Loop and catch issues early
- **Code** - Review and refine with Code Diff for reliable delivery

These features work together to ensure precision and control throughout your development process.

## Additional Capabilities

### Context Awareness: Deep Codebase Understanding

Verdent's context management system enables comprehensive project comprehension:

#### Massive Context Window

- **1M Token Capacity** - Ingest entire medium-sized codebases (~750,000 words or 3,000+ files)
- **Smart Context Loading** - Automatically prioritizes relevant files based on task context
- **Sub-Agent Context Optimization** - Delegates specialized tasks to focused sub-agents

#### Adaptive Learning

- **Convention Detection** - Learns project-specific patterns (naming, file organization, error handling)
- **Style Mimicry** - Generates code matching existing style (indentation, brace placement, comments)
- **Library Awareness** - Recognizes frameworks in use, preferring them over new dependencies

#### Cross-File Coherence

- **Dependency Tracking** - Understands imports, exports, and module relationships
- **Impact Prediction** - Identifies components affected by proposed changes
- **Consistency Enforcement** - Ensures modifications align with existing architecture

### Specialized Sub-Agents: Division of Labor

Verdent orchestrates specialized AI agents optimized for specific development tasks:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Explorer Agent">
    **Purpose:** Fast, evidence-based codebase navigation and analysis

    **Capabilities:**

    - **Pattern Matching** - Locate files using glob patterns (e.g., all TypeScript files, backend API files)
    - **Semantic Search** - Find code by functionality (e.g., "where is authentication middleware implemented?")
    - **Multi-Location Synthesis** - Aggregate information from multiple files

    **Thoroughness Levels:**

    - **Quick:** Basic pattern matching for fast answers
    - **Medium:** Broader search with contextual confirmation
    - **Very Thorough:** Exhaustive scan with variant checking and cross-references

    **Use Cases:** "Find all database query functions", "Locate configuration loading logic", "How does the app handle errors?"
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Verifier Agent">
    **Purpose:** Rapid code quality checks and validation

    **Capabilities:**

    - **Lint Checks** - ESLint, Pylint, Rubocop, etc.
    - **Type Validation** - TypeScript, mypy, Flow type checking
    - **Fast Test Execution** - Targeted unit tests with under 30s budget
    - **Diff-Focused Verification** - Validate only changed code for efficiency

    **Fail-Fast Philosophy:** Returns structured error reports on first real issue, avoiding time waste

    **Use Cases:** Pre-commit checks, post-fix validation, quick sanity tests
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Code Reviewer Agent">
    **Purpose:** Comprehensive code quality, security, and maintainability audits

    **Capabilities:**

    - **Security Analysis** - Vulnerability scanning, credential exposure detection, injection risk assessment
    - **Architecture Review** - Design pattern validation, SOLID principle adherence, anti-pattern detection
    - **Performance Analysis** - Algorithmic complexity, resource leaks, optimization opportunities
    - **Documentation Completeness** - Comment quality, API documentation, README accuracy

    **Review Depth:** More thorough than Verifier, suitable for pre-merge PR reviews

    **Use Cases:** Feature completion review, security audit, refactoring validation
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Flexible Collaboration Modes

Choose the level of autonomy that fits your workflow:

- **Auto Run Mode** - Executes tasks autonomously while notifying you of potentially risky actions
- **Manual Accept Mode** - Requires your approval for every change before execution
- **Skip Permissions Mode** - Fully autonomous execution, including risky operations (advanced users only)

See [Execution Modes & Permissions](/verdent-for-vscode/execution-modes/overview) for detailed mode documentation.

---

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration

Enables interoperability with external tools and services:

- Extends functionality through existing toolchains and custom plugins
- Works seamlessly with sub-agents to support distributed task execution
- Supports integration with external APIs, databases, and development tools

See [Integration & Extensions](/verdent-for-vscode/advanced-features/integrations) for MCP setup and configuration.
