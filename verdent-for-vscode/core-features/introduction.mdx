## Clear Mode: Precision Control Over AI Workflows

Clear Mode provides granular control over agent behavior and acceptance criteria through multiple input modalities:

#### Multi-Modal Specification

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Natural Language">
    Express requirements, constraints, and acceptance criteria in plain English:

    - Rich contextual understanding of technical and business requirements
    - Supports complex, multi-layered specifications
    - Natural conversation flow for requirement definition
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Visual Requirements">
    Upload UI mockups, design screenshots, or reference implementations:

    - Pixel-perfect recreation from visual specifications
    - Supports multiple image formats for design communication
    - Visual context for UI/UX implementation
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Interactive Demos">
    Share working examples or prototypes:

    - Communicate behavior and user experience expectations
    - Demonstrate complex interactions and workflows
    - Live examples for clearer requirement communication
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This multi-modal approach ensures complex requirements, especially UI/UX specifications, are captured accurately without ambiguity.

## Blueprint: Professional Requirement Engineering

The Blueprint system transforms informal ideas into production-ready implementation plans through structured, collaborative processes.

#### Intelligent Requirement Clarification

Verdent engages as a technical partner:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Exploratory Dialogue">
    Multi-turn conversations to uncover implicit requirements:

    - Edge case identification and technical constraint discovery
    - Proactive ambiguity resolution before implementation
    - Iterative refinement through collaborative discussion
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Domain Expertise">
    Applies software engineering best practices:

    - Suggests optimal approaches, design patterns, and technology choices
    - Presents trade-off analysis with pros/cons for informed decision-making
    - Recommends industry-standard solutions and frameworks
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Professional Blueprint Generation

Comprehensive, developer-ready blueprints include:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Requirement Overview">
    High-level summary of goals, scope, and success criteria to establish project direction.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Task Breakdown">
    Hierarchical list with dependencies and priorities to organize implementation workflow.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Technical Design">
    Detailed specification including:

    - Component structure and relationships
    - Data models and API contracts
    - UI/UX specifications with visual mockups
    - Technology stack justification
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Format:**
- Rich, interactive documents with collapsible sections
- Embedded diagrams (sequence diagrams, architecture diagrams, flowcharts)
- Code snippets and pseudocode for critical logic
- Links to relevant documentation and resources

#### Inline Editing and Iterative Refinement

Blueprints are living documents:

- **Contextual Selection** - Highlight specific sections for focused discussion
- **Targeted Modifications** - Request changes without disrupting overall plan

- **Modular Composition** - Reference and combine blueprints across projects
- **Template Library** - Build reusable patterns for common scenarios (CRUD, API integrations, UI components)

---

## Code Diff: Professional Code Review Workflow

Enterprise-grade change management and review capabilities ensure transparent, traceable, high-quality modifications.

#### Natural Language Diff Summaries

Understand changes before diving into code:

- **Change Localization** - Lists all modified files with context
- **Logic Summarization** - Explains what changed and why in plain English
- **Impact Analysis** - Highlights downstream effects on documentation, APIs, and dependent code

#### Senior Engineer-Level Code Review

Multi-dimensional code analysis:

**Quality Checks:**
- **Correctness** - Logic errors, edge case handling, potential bugs
- **Performance** - Algorithmic complexity, resource usage, scalability concerns
- **Security** - Vulnerability scanning (injection attacks, insecure dependencies, credential exposure)
- **Maintainability** - Code clarity, documentation, adherence to project conventions
- **Test Coverage** - Identification of untested code paths and missing test cases

**Review Output:**
- Categorized findings (Critical / Major / Minor)
- Specific line references with suggested fixes
- Explanations of why changes are recommended
- Code snippets demonstrating improvements

#### Interactive Review Acceptance

Navigate and manage changes efficiently:

- **Side-by-Side Diff View** - Visual comparison with syntax highlighting
- **Quick Actions** - Accept, Reject, Undo, Navigate to file locations
- **Batch Operations** - Accept/reject multiple related changes simultaneously
- **Annotation** - Add comments to specific changes for future reference

## Verify Loop: Automated Quality Assurance

The Verify Loop validates that implemented code meets specifications through configurable automated verification.

#### Configurable Automated Verification

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Verification Scope">
    Choose validation coverage:

    - Full codebase scan
    - Modified files only (code diff)
    - Specific modules or features
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Verification Tools">
    Integrate existing tools:

    - Linters: ESLint, Pylint, Rubocop
    - Type Checkers: TypeScript compiler, mypy, Flow
    - Formatters: Prettier, Black, gofmt
    - Security Scanners: npm audit, Snyk, Bandit
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Test Execution">
    Run comprehensive tests:

    - Unit tests (Jest, pytest, JUnit)
    - Integration tests
    - End-to-end tests (Playwright, Cypress)
    - Performance benchmarks
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Model Selection:** Choose AI models for intelligent test generation and failure analysis (fast/cheap vs. thorough/expensive).

#### HAI (Human-AI) Loop: Continuous Improvement

The HAI Loop creates a feedback cycle that refines both code and requirements:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Blueprint Definition">
    Define requirements, acceptance criteria, and project specifications in a structured blueprint document.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Case Generation">
    Generate test cases automatically from acceptance criteria defined in the blueprint.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Implementation">
    Write code to implement the features specified in the blueprint.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Code Generation">
    Generate unit and integration tests to validate the implementation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Automated Test Execution">
    Run all generated tests automatically to verify code correctness.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Results Analysis">
    Analyze test results and determine next steps:
    - **Pass**: Implementation complete
    - **Fail**: Update blueprint or code and repeat the loop
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Benefits:**
- **Specification Alignment** - Ensures code matches blueprint intent
- **Regression Prevention** - Auto-generated tests become permanent safeguards
- **Documentation Sync** - Test cases serve as executable documentation
- **Continuous Validation** - Re-run on every change to catch breakages early
