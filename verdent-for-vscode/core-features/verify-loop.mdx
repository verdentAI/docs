description: "Automated quality assurance with configurable verification and continuous validation"
---

The Verify Loop is Verdent's **Verify** phase tool, ensuring code meets specifications through automated testing before delivery. The Verify Loop validates that implemented code meets specifications through configurable automated verification.

### What You'll Learn

- Configurable automated verification
- HAI (Human-AI) Loop continuous improvement
- Benefits of automated validation

## Configurable Automated Verification

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Verification Scope">
    Choose validation coverage:

    - Full codebase scan
    - Modified files only (code diff)
    - Specific modules or features
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Verification Tools">
    Integrate existing tools:

    - Linters: ESLint, Pylint, Rubocop
    - Type Checkers: TypeScript compiler, mypy, Flow
    - Formatters: Prettier, Black, gofmt
    - Security Scanners: npm audit, Snyk, Bandit
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Test Execution">
    Run comprehensive tests:

    - Unit tests (Jest, pytest, JUnit)
    - Integration tests
    - End-to-end tests (Playwright, Cypress)
    - Performance benchmarks
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Model Selection:** Choose AI models for intelligent test generation and failure analysis (fast/cheap vs. thorough/expensive).

## Human-AI Loop: Continuous Improvement

The HAI Loop creates a feedback cycle that refines both code and requirements:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Plan Definition">
    Define requirements, acceptance criteria, and project specifications in a structured plan document.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Case Generation">
    Generate test cases automatically from acceptance criteria defined in the blueprint.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implementation">
    Write code to implement the features specified in the blueprint.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Code Generation">
    Generate unit and integration tests to validate the implementation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automated Test Execution">
    Run all generated tests automatically to verify code correctness.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Results Analysis">
    Analyze test results and determine next steps:

    - **Pass**: Implementation complete
    - **Fail**: Update blueprint or code and repeat the loop
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Benefits:**

- **Specification Alignment** - Ensures code matches plan intent
- **Regression Prevention** - Auto-generated tests become permanent safeguards
- **Documentation Sync** - Test cases serve as executable documentation
- **Continuous Validation** - Re-run on every change to catch breakages early
