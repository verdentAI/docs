## Configurable Automated Verification

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Verification Scope">
    Choose validation coverage:

    - Full codebase scan
    - Modified files only (code diff)
    - Specific modules or features
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Verification Tools">
    Integrate existing tools:

    - Linters: ESLint, Pylint, Rubocop
    - Type Checkers: TypeScript compiler, mypy, Flow
    - Formatters: Prettier, Black, gofmt
    - Security Scanners: npm audit, Snyk, Bandit
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Test Execution">
    Run comprehensive tests:

    - Unit tests (Jest, pytest, JUnit)
    - Integration tests
    - End-to-end tests (Playwright, Cypress)
    - Performance benchmarks
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Model Selection:** Choose AI models for intelligent test generation and failure analysis (fast/cheap vs. thorough/expensive).

## What is Verify Loop

It combines intelligent code analysis with powerful automation to ensure that your codebase meets the necessary functional, security, and performance standards before deployment.

1. **Smart Code Verification**\
   Verdent analyzes your codebase to understand its structure and purpose. Based on the task at hand, it automatically triggers the right verification tools to check your code’s functionality.
2. **Automatic Use of Subagents and Browser Tools**\
   After understanding your code, Verdent triggers the _verify subagent_ and _browser tool_ to validate both backend logic and frontend performance. This ensures everything works as expected across different browsers and environments.
3. **Customizable Rules and Subagents**\
   You can set up custom validation rules using Verdent’s _rules_ engine to match your project’s needs. Additionally, you can create your own _subagents_ to perform specialized checks, giving you more control over how your code is verified.
4. **Scalability and Flexibility**\
   Verdent is built to scale with your project. Whether you're working on a small feature or a large application, Verdent adapts its validation process to suit your needs.
5. **Verification Loop for Continuous Improvement**\
   If Verdent finds that your code doesn’t meet the delivery requirements, it enters a **verification loop**. In this loop, Verdent automatically makes fixes and revalidates the code multiple times until it meets all the necessary criteria. This ensures that your code is continuously improved and fully validated before final delivery.

**Benefits:**

- **Specification Alignment** - Ensures code matches plan intent
- **Regression Prevention** - Auto-generated tests become permanent safeguards
- **Continuous Validation** - Re-run on every change to catch breakages early
