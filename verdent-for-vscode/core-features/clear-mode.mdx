The **Plan-Code-Verify loop** provides precise control over requirements, implementation, and validation through multiple input modalities.

### What You'll Learn

- What is Plan-Verify-Code workflow
- Multi-modal specification methods (natural language, visual, interactive)
- Automating verification and delivering production-ready code

## Plan-Verify-Code Workflow

Clear Mode integrates all three phases of Verdent's workflow:

**Plan:** Clarify requirements and design solutions with clear, visual logic diagrams. Express specifications through natural language, UI mockups, or interactive demos.

**Verify:** Automate test interactions and catch issues early with a verifier subagent and browser tools. Validation happens continuously throughout development.

**Code:** Review, refactor, and improve your code with ease, and deliver clear results every time. Multi-modal inputs ensure implementation matches exact requirements.

## Multi-Modal Specification

Clear Mode supports multiple ways to express your requirements:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Natural Language">
    Express requirements, constraints, and acceptance criteria in plain English:

    - Rich contextual understanding of technical and business requirements
    - Supports complex, multi-layered specifications
    - Natural conversation flow for requirement definition
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Visual Requirements">
    Upload UI mockups, design screenshots, or reference implementations:

    - Pixel-perfect recreation from visual specifications
    - Supports multiple image formats for design communication
    - Visual context for UI/UX implementation
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Interactive Demos">
    Share working examples or prototypes:

    - Communicate behavior and user experience expectations
    - Demonstrate complex interactions and workflows
    - Live examples for clearer requirement communication
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This multi-modal approach ensures complex requirements, especially UI/UX specifications, are captured accurately without ambiguity.
