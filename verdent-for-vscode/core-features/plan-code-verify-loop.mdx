### What You'll Learn

- What is Plan-Code-Verify workflow
- Multi-modal specification methods (natural language, visual, interactive)

## **Plan-Code-Verify** Workflow

Integrates all three phases of Verdent's workflow:

**Plan:** Clarify requirements and design solutions with clear, visual logic diagrams and plan rules. Express specifications through natural language, UI mockups, or interactive demos.

**Code**:Review, refactor, and improve your code with ease, and deliver clear results every time. Multi-modal inputs ensure implementation matches exact requirements.

**Verify:** Catch issues early with a verifier subagent and browser tools for reliability results.

**How Plan-Code-Verify Workflow works：**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Plan Rules">
    - Choose built-in role templates (Frontend, Test, Product Manager)
    - Creating custom plan rules that match your thinking style and work habits
  </Step>
  <Step title="Plan Preview">
    - Clarify the structure and content of the plan through plan review
    - After aligning with the AI during the plan review, click ‘Generate Plan’ to create the detailed plan content
  </Step>
  <Step title="Plan Design">
    Detailed specification including:

    - System architecture diagrams
    - Component structure and relationships
    - Data models and API contracts
    - UI/UX specifications with visual mockups
    - Technology stack justification
  </Step>
  <Step title="Task Breakdown">
    Hierarchical list with dependencies and priorities to organize implementation workflow

    - Display the real-time progress of tasks
    - Summarize their completion status once finished
  </Step>
  <Step title="Diff Summaries">
    Review Code Changes and Code-reviewer Subagent

    - Change Localization - Lists all modified files with Code Changes
    - Logic Summarization - Explains what changed and why in plain English
    - Impact Analysis - Highlights downstream effects on documentation, APIs, and dependent code
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Earlier ">
    - Configurable automated verification
    - Verify with Subagents and browser Tools
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Multi-Modal Specification

Supports multiple ways to express your requirements:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Natural Language">
    Express requirements, constraints, and acceptance criteria in plain English:

    - Rich contextual understanding of technical and business requirements
    - Supports complex, multi-layered specifications
    - Natural conversation flow for requirement definition
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Visual Requirements">
    Upload UI mockups, design screenshots, or reference implementations:

    - Pixel-perfect recreation from visual specifications
    - Supports multiple image formats for design communication
    - Visual context for UI/UX implementation
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Interactive Demos">
    Share working examples or prototypes:

    - Communicate behavior and user experience expectations
    - Demonstrate complex interactions and workflows
    - Live examples for clearer requirement communication
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This multi-modal approach ensures complex requirements, especially UI/UX specifications, are captured accurately without ambiguity.
