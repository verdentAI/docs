## How Credits Work

Credits are the universal usage unit across Verdent for VS Code. Each AI operation consumes credits based on:

- **Model Type** - More powerful models (e.g., Claude Sonnet 4.5) consume more credits than lightweight models (e.g., Claude Haiku)
- **Context Size** - Larger context windows (more code/files in conversation) increase credit consumption
- **Operation Complexity** - Simple queries use fewer credits than complex multi-file analysis or code generation

**Credit Consumption Rates:**

| Model | Requests per 100 Credits | Best For |
|-------|--------------------------|----------|
| Claude Haiku | ~450 requests | Quick queries, simple tasks, rapid prototyping |
| GPT-5 / GPT-5-Codex | ~186 requests | Reasoning and creativity tasks, code generation (Beta) |
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | ~140 requests | General development, balanced performance (baseline) |
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 1M | ~70 requests | Extended context when input exceeds 200k tokens |

**Credit Transparency:**
- View real-time credit balance in User Center (top bar of Verdent panel)
- Track credit usage per session
- Usage updates in real-time as you use Verdent
- Detailed usage history and analytics available on the [Verdent Dashboard](https://www.verdent.ai/dashboard)

    - Credits refresh every month according to your Stripe billing cycle
    - Cancel anytime through account settings
    - Credits remain valid until end of billing period

## Managing Your Subscription

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Upgrade">
    **Instant Upgrade Process:**
    - No double billing - previous plan automatically canceled
    - Pay only the difference between plans
    - Upgrade is instant
    - Remaining credits and unused days automatically carry over
    - Billing cycle syncs for seamless experience

    <Tip>
    Upgrading immediately gives you access to the new plan's credit allocation, and any remaining credits from your previous plan are preserved.

    **Downgrade Process:**
    - Takes effect at next billing cycle
    - Use remaining credits until cycle ends

    <Note>
    Downgrading doesn't take effect immediately - you keep your current plan benefits until the end of your billing period.
    </Note>
  </Tab>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="What happens if I run out of credits?">
When you run out of credits, Verdent will prompt you to either:
- Purchase a credit top-up for immediate access
