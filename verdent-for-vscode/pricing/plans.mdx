## Model Credit Consumption

Different AI models consume credits at different rates:

| Model                | Cost Efficiency                 | Use Case                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Claude Sonnet 4.5    | 1x baseline                     | General development, balanced performance                                             |
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 1M | 0.5x efficiency (2x cost)       | Large codebases, complex reasoning, extended context (when input exceeds 200k tokens) |
| Claude Haiku         | 3.2x more efficient than Sonnet | Quick queries, fast responses, simple tasks                                           |
| GPT-5 / GPT-5-Codex  | 1.3x more efficient than Sonnet | Reasoning and creativity tasks, code generation (Beta)                                |

**Optimization Tips:**

- Use Haiku for simple queries to save credits (3.2x more efficient than Sonnet)
- Reserve Sonnet 1M for complex multi-file analysis requiring extended context
- Balance model selection with task complexity to optimize credit usage
- Monitor your usage on the [Verdent Dashboard](https://www.verdent.ai/dashboard) to track consumption patterns and analytics
