description: Managing tokens, credits, and computational resources

---

Verdent for VS Code uses a credit-based system to manage computational resources. Understanding credit usage, quotas, and monitoring helps you optimize performance and manage costs effectively.

---

## Credit & Token Monitoring

### Credit Balance (In VS Code)

Monitor your credit balance through the **User Center** in VS Code:
- Click the User Center button in the top bar of the Verdent panel
- View account name, current plan, and credit balance
- See total credits (subscription + top-ups), credits left in subscription, and remaining top-up credits
- Credit balance updates in real-time as you use Verdent

### Token Usage Monitoring (Website Dashboard)

For detailed token usage analytics and monitoring:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Dashboard">
    Visit the [Verdent Dashboard](https://verdent.ai/dashboard) on the official website
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Token Usage">
    Check detailed token consumption across all your sessions and projects
  </Step>

  <Step title="Analyze Patterns">
    Review usage patterns, model selection impact, and cost optimization opportunities
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
**Credit balance** (available in VS Code User Center) shows your remaining credits. **Token usage details** (available on website Dashboard) show granular consumption analytics for optimization.

## Managing Long-Running Tasks

Effective resource management requires strategic session planning. See [Best Practices: Context](/verdent-for-vscode/best-practices/context) for detailed guidance on breaking tasks into chunks, monitoring performance, and context window optimization (200K vs 1M tokens).

**Quick Tips:**
- Use Plan Mode for complex changes to understand scope before execution
- Start fresh sessions between major tasks to reset context and tool approvals
- Complete atomic work units (feature → test → commit), then start fresh sessions
- Watch for slower responses or less accurate outputs as sessions grow longer
