### What You'll Learn

This section covers Verdent's power-user capabilities including subagent management, rule systems, custom tool integration, and advanced extensibility options.

## Complex Feature Explanations

Verdent for VS Code provides sophisticated features that enable advanced development workflows beyond basic code generation.

### Subagent System

**Specialized AI Agents:**
Verdent includes built-in subagents (`@Verifier`, `@Explorer`, `@Code-reviewer`) that operate with isolated context windows and custom system prompts. Each subagent specializes in specific tasks like code exploration, validation, or quality review.

**Automatic & Manual Delegation:**
The main agent automatically routes tasks to appropriate subagents based on request patterns, or users can manually specify subagents using @-mentions. This delegation preserves main context while handling specialized operations efficiently.

**Custom Subagents:**
Create project-specific subagents by defining markdown files with YAML frontmatter in `~/.verdent/subagents/`. Custom subagents can specialize in domain expertise, team workflows, or technology-specific optimizations.

### Rule Systems

**Behavior Customization:**
Rule files guide Verdent's behavior, output formatting, and decision-making through plain Markdown documents. Three rule types control different scopes:

- **user_rules.md** - Global personal preferences across all projects
- **AGENTS.md** - Project-specific team standards (version controlled)
- **plan_rules.md** - Plan Mode output format customization

**Rule Precedence:**
When conflicts occur, project rules (`AGENTS.md`) override user rules, ensuring team consistency while preserving personal preferences for solo projects.

### Tool System & MCP

**Built-in Tools:**
Verdent provides comprehensive tools for file operations, search (`glob`/`grep`), command execution (`bash`), web access, and agent delegation. Tools enable all code manipulation, navigation, and external interaction.

**Model Context Protocol (MCP):**
MCP extends Verdent's capabilities by connecting to external tools, data sources, and services. Configure MCP servers through Settings → MCP Servers to integrate project-specific APIs and custom functionality.

## Multi-Agent Coordination

Verdent's multi-subagent architecture enables parallel task execution with automatic routing and coordination.

**Main Agent (Orchestrator):**
The primary agent analyzes requests, breaks down complex tasks, and delegates specialized work to subagents while maintaining conversation context and consolidating results.

**Parallel Execution:**
Multiple subagents run concurrently for complex operations. Example: Explorer subagent searches the codebase while Code-reviewer analyzes security simultaneously, delivering faster results.

**Context Isolation:**
Each subagent operates with its own context window. Only final results consume space in the main agent's context, preventing exhaustion during multi-step operations.

**Task Routing:**
Automatic detection routes tasks based on patterns:
- Codebase questions → `@Explorer` subagent
- Security reviews → `@Code-reviewer` subagent
- Validation checks → `@Verifier` subagent

## Custom Workflow Creation

Advanced users can customize Verdent's behavior to match team processes and project requirements.

**Custom Subagent Workflows:**
Create specialized subagents for domain-specific needs:
- **API documentation generators** - Extract endpoints and parameters from code
- **Database migration reviewers** - Validate schema changes for safety
- **Accessibility auditors** - Check frontend code for WCAG compliance

**Rule-Based Customization:**
Define coding standards, testing requirements, and output preferences through rule files:
- Enforce team conventions (indentation, naming, patterns)
- Specify documentation styles and comment detail levels
- Control Plan Mode output structure and granularity

**Extensibility Through MCP:**
Integrate external tools and services:
- Database query tools
- Cloud service APIs (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Project management integrations (Jira, Linear)
- CI/CD pipeline connections

## Advanced Context Management Techniques

Efficient context management is critical for complex projects and long coding sessions.

**Strategic File Reading:**
Use `file_read` with line ranges for large files to avoid context overload. Read only sections needed for the task rather than entire files.

**Subagent Delegation for Research:**
Delegate exploratory tasks to `@Explorer` subagent to keep main conversation context clean. Subagent research results consume minimal main context space.

**Search Before Reading:**
Use `grep_file` to identify relevant files before reading full contents. Combine `glob` patterns with `grep_content` for precise searches that minimize unnecessary file operations.

**Context-Aware Tool Selection:**
- **Large codebases:** `@Explorer` subagent for architecture understanding
- **Isolated validation:** `@Verifier` subagent for quick checks
- **Security reviews:** `@Code-reviewer` subagent for quality assessment

**Monitoring Context Usage:**
Track which subagents are executing through Chat View indicators. Subagent operations appear in conversation history with progress indicators and result attribution.
