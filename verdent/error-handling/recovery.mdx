## Session Controls

    Click **Stop** to halt operations going in the wrong direction
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assess Changes">
    Click **Task Changes** to review what was modified
  </Step>
  <Step title="Decide on Approach">

## Workspace Recovery

| Issue | Recovery |
|-------|----------|
| **Stuck workspace** | Stop agent, review changes |
| **Wrong changes** | Stop immediately, revert with Source Control |
| **Can't create workspace** | Commit changes first, check disk space |

### Parallel Agent Issues

| Scenario | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| **One agent stuck** | Stop and restart that agent only |
| **All agents stuck** | Check connectivity, restart app |
| **Conflicting changes** | Review each workspace, rebase carefully |
