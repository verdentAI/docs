title: Execution Modes
description: "Agent Mode and Plan Mode in Verdent"
---

Verdent provides two execution modes that control how the AI agent interacts with your codebase: Agent Mode for full autonomous execution and Plan Mode for read-only planning.

## What You'll Learn

- How Agent Mode and Plan Mode work
- When to use each mode
- Desktop-specific considerations for parallel agents

### Key Modes

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Agent Mode" icon="play">
    Default mode with full autonomous execution. Read, write, and execute commands to implement changes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Plan Mode" icon="clipboard-list">
    Read-only planning mode. Analyze codebase and create detailed plans before any execution.
  </Card>

## Execution Modes Overview

| Mode | Description | File Access | Best For |
|------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Agent Mode** | Full autonomous execution | Read/Write | Implementation, coding tasks |
| **Plan Mode** | Read-only planning | Read-only | Complex planning, analysis |

---

## Agent Mode

Agent Mode is the default execution mode where Verdent has full capability to read, write, and execute commands autonomously.

### How It Works

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Capabilities">
    **File Operations:**
    - Read files and analyze code
    - Create, modify, and delete files
    - Organize and rename files

    **Execution:**
    - Run terminal commands
    - Execute tests and builds
    - Install packages
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="When to Use">
    - Active development and coding
    - Implementing features
    - Bug fixes and refactoring
    - Running tests and builds
    - File organization and cleanup
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Activation

Agent Mode is the default. Press `Shift+Tab` or `Ctrl+.` to switch between modes.

### Safety in Agent Mode

Agent Mode includes built-in protections:

| Protection | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Dangerous Command Detection** | Warns before destructive commands |
| **Git Safety Net** | Version control provides rollback capability |
| **Workspace Isolation** | Changes scoped to current workspace |

<Tip>
Always use version control (Git) when working in Agent Mode. This provides a safety net for reverting unintended changes.
</Tip>

## Plan Mode

Plan Mode ensures you and Verdent understand and align on requirements before any code changes occur. Instead of jumping into implementation, Verdent works with you to clarify scope, surface edge cases, and document the approach in a `plan.md` file.

### Core Purpose

Plan Mode solves a common AI development problem: the agent starts writing code before fully understanding what you want. By separating planning from execution:

- **Requirements become explicit** - Verdent asks clarifying questions until scope is clear
- **Assumptions get surfaced** - Edge cases and design decisions are discussed upfront
- **You control the direction** - Review and edit the plan before any code is written

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Analysis">
    Verdent reads files and analyzes your codebase
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clarification">
    Asks questions to understand your requirements and align on the goal
  </Step>
  <Step title="Planning">
    Creates a `plan.md` file with implementation steps and file changes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review">
    You review and optionally edit `plan.md` before execution
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute">
    Switch to **Agent Mode** to execute the plan
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What Plan Mode Can Do

| Can Do | Cannot Do |
|--------|-----------|
| Read files | Write or edit files |
| Analyze code | Execute commands |
| Search codebase | Make commits |
| Create plans | Run tests |
| Ask questions | Modify settings |
| Documentation design | - |
| Visual diagrams | - |

### When to Use Plan Mode

| Scenario | Why Plan Mode |
|----------|---------------|
| Complex multi-file changes | See full scope before execution |
| Unfamiliar codebase | Safe exploration without risk |
| Architectural decisions | Thoughtful analysis first |
| Production code changes | Review approach before committing |
| Team alignment | Share plan before implementation |

### Activation

Use **Switch Mode** in the Chat Input Box or press `Shift+Tab` / `Ctrl+.` (`Cmd+.` on macOS) to switch to Plan Mode.

## Desktop-Specific Considerations

### Parallel Agents and Modes

Each workspace can have its own agent with independent mode settings:

| Workspace | Recommended Mode |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Base workspace** | Plan Mode for major changes |
| **Feature workspaces** | Agent Mode for implementation |
| **Review workspaces** | Plan Mode for analysis |

### Mode Independence

Each agent operates independently:

- Mode settings don't affect other agents
- File operations are workspace-scoped
- No cross-workspace conflicts
- Agents can use different modes simultaneously

### Recommended Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Plan in Base">
    Use Plan Mode in base workspace to design approach
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Workspace">
    Click **New Workspace** in the Top Bar for implementation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement in Agent Mode">
    Use Agent Mode in the workspace to execute
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Changes">
    Click **Task Changes** to review changes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rebase to main branch">
    Click **Workspace Actions → Rebase to main branch**
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Choosing the Right Mode

| Task | Recommended Mode |
|------|------------------|
| Learning Verdent | Start with Plan Mode |
| Unfamiliar codebase | Plan Mode first |
| Active development | Agent Mode |
| Complex planning | Plan Mode |
| Multi-file refactoring | Plan Mode → Agent Mode |
| Quick fixes | Agent Mode |
| Architectural decisions | Plan Mode |
| Critical production changes | Plan Mode |

## Safety Best Practices

### General Guidelines

1. **Use Version Control** - Git provides rollback safety
2. **Start with Plan Mode** - For unfamiliar or complex work
3. **Review Before Committing** - Check all diffs after operations
4. **Use Workspace Isolation** - Keep experimental work separate

### Parallel Safety

Each agent only modifies its own workspace:

- Base workspace remains stable
- Conflicts resolved during rebase
- Review each workspace's changes before rebasing

## FAQs

<Accordion title="Can I switch modes mid-task?">
Yes. Press `Shift+Tab` or `Ctrl+.` to switch. Switching to Plan Mode stops execution and enters read-only analysis. Switching to Agent Mode enables execution.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can parallel agents have different modes?">
Yes. Each agent in each workspace has independent mode settings. One workspace can use Plan Mode while another uses Agent Mode simultaneously.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does Plan Mode use credits?">
Yes. Plan Mode uses credits for AI analysis and planning, though typically less than Agent Mode since no execution occurs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I execute a plan later?">
Yes. After creating a plan in Plan Mode, switch to Agent Mode to execute it. The plan guides the execution.
</Accordion>
