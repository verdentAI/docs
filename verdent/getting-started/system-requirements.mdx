title: System Requirements & Compatibility
description: "Supported platforms, system requirements, and compatibility information for Verdent"
---

Verdent is a desktop application. The requirements below help ensure smooth performance.

---

## Supported Operating Systems

| Operating System | Supported Versions | Architecture |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **macOS** | macOS 11 (Big Sur) and later | Intel and Apple Silicon |
| **Windows** | Windows 10, Windows 11 | 64-bit only |

<Note>
32-bit operating systems are not supported. Windows 7 and 8.x are not supported. Linux is not currently supported.
</Note>

---

## Hardware Requirements

### Minimum

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **RAM** | 4 GB |
| **Disk Space** | ~900 MB for the application |
| **CPU** | Any 64-bit processor |

### Recommended

* **RAM**: 8 GB or more  
* **CPU**: Multi-core processor  
* **Disk Space**: 2 GB+ (app + project files + caching)

---

## Disk Space Notes

Verdent may create additional copies of your project files when using multiple workspaces.

| Component | Space Required |
|----------|----------------|
| **Application** | ~900 MB |
| **Per workspace** | Depends on project size |
| **Session History** | ~50 MB per project (typical) |
| **Caching** | ~100 MB (typical) |

<Note>
If you work with large projects and many workspaces, disk usage can grow quickly.
</Note>

---

## Network Requirements

Verdent requires an **active internet connection** to communicate with AI services. The application does not work offline.

---

## Optional Dependencies

<Accordion title="Git dependency (managed by Verdent)">
Verdent uses Git worktrees for workspace isolation.

You don’t need to install Git ahead of time. If Git is missing or incompatible, Verdent will prompt you after launch and guide you through installation.

See: [Git Installation Guide](/verdent/getting-started/git-installation)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Node.js (optional)">
Node.js is optional, and only needed if you use MCP servers that run on Node.js.

**Minimum version:** Node.js 18+
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Firewall / proxy considerations (enterprise)">
In corporate environments, outbound HTTPS access must be allowed for Verdent service endpoints.  
Proxy servers should pass through API requests. SSL/TLS inspection may require exceptions.

If you continue to see connection failures after network configuration, contact Verdent support for endpoint details.
</Accordion>

Verdent works with all text-based file formats through its file operation tools.
