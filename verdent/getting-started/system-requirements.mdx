## Advanced

<Accordion title="Git dependency (managed by Verdent)">
Verdent uses Git worktrees for workspace isolation.

You don’t need to install Git ahead of time. If Git is missing or incompatible, Verdent will prompt you after launch and guide you through installation.

See: [Git Installation Guide](/verdent/getting-started/git-installation)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Node.js (optional)">
Node.js is optional, and only needed if you use MCP servers that run on Node.js.

**Minimum version:** Node.js 18+
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Firewall / proxy considerations (enterprise)">
In corporate environments, outbound HTTPS access must be allowed for Verdent service endpoints.  
Proxy servers should pass through API requests. SSL/TLS inspection may require exceptions.

If you continue to see connection failures after network configuration, contact Verdent support for endpoint details.
