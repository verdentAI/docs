---

This guide walks you through downloading Verdent, completing platform-specific installation, and authenticating with your Verdent account.

---

## Requirements

Before installing Verdent, ensure your system meets these prerequisites:

### System Requirements

* **Operating System**: macOS 11+ or Windows 10+ (64-bit)
* **Git**: Version 2.20 or higher ([Installation Guide](/verdent/getting-started/git-installation))  
  Verdent uses Git worktrees for workspace isolation. Your project folder does not need to be a Git repository, but some features require Git and Verdent may guide you to initialize a repo when needed.
* **Internet Connection**: Active connection required for AI service communication

### Optional but Recommended

* **Disk Space**: At least 2 GB free (more recommended for large repositories, worktrees, and caching)

See [System Requirements](/verdent/getting-started/system-requirements) for detailed compatibility information.
