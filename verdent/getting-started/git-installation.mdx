description: "Installing Git for Verdent"
---

Verdent uses **Git worktrees** to create isolated workspaces. Git is a required dependency, but you **don’t need to install it ahead of time**.

<Note>
On first launch, Verdent checks whether Git is available and compatible.  
If Git is missing or outdated, Verdent will prompt you and guide you through installation.  
This page provides manual installation options if you prefer to set it up yourself.
</Note>

## Why Verdent Uses Git

Verdent relies on Git worktrees to manage isolated workspaces safely:

| Feature | What Git Enables |
|---------|------------------|
| **Workspace Isolation** | Separate working directories via worktrees |
| **Independent Changes** | Each workspace can have its own branch and state |
| **Git Workflow Compatibility** | Works with standard Git tools and workflows |

**Minimum Version:** Git 2.20+  
**Recommended Version:** Git 2.30+

## FAQs

<Accordion title="What is Git?">
Git is a free, open-source version control system that tracks changes to your files. Verdent uses Git worktrees to create isolated workspaces.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use Verdent without Git?">
No. Git worktrees are fundamental to Verdent’s workspace isolation. Without Git, Verdent cannot create or manage isolated workspaces.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if my project isn't a Git repository?">
Verdent can still work with folders that are not Git repositories. If Git initialization is required for workspace isolation, Verdent will prompt you and guide you through the next step.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why do I need Git 2.20+?">
Verdent requires Git 2.20+ for compatibility with worktree-based workflows. We recommend Git 2.30+ for smoother worktree operations.
