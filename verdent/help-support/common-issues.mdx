    ### Missing Models (Claude, GPT, Gemini)

    **Issue:** Cannot find Claude, GPT, or Gemini models in model selection

    **Reason:** Location-based restrictions from model providers

    **Explanation:** Some AI model providers have regional restrictions that prevent certain models from being available in specific geographic locations. When this happens:
    - Restricted models will not appear in your model selection menu
    - You can still use all other available models without interruption
    - No impact on your subscription or credits

    **Check Available Models:** Visit https://www.verdent.ai/regions to see which models are available in your region

    <Note>
    Regional restrictions are set by the AI model providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google), not by Verdent. Verdent cannot override these restrictions.
    </Note>
  </Tab>

## Tool-Specific Issues

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="file_edit Failures">
    ### file_edit Failures

    **Error:** "Failed to find exact match"

    **Causes:**
    - Text changed since last file_read
    - Whitespace differences (tabs vs spaces)
    - String not unique in file

    **Solutions:**
    ```bash
    # 1. Read file again to get current state
    file_read("file.js")

    # 2. Use larger context string for uniqueness
    file_edit("file.js",
      old_string="function foo() {\n  return 42;\n}",
      new_string="...")

    # 3. For multiple identical strings, use replace_all
    file_edit("file.js", old_string="TODO", new_string="DONE", replace_all=true)
    ```

    <Warning>
    Always read the file immediately before editing to ensure you have the current state.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="bash Failures">
    ### bash Command Failures

    **Error:** Command timeout or execution failure

    **Maximum Timeout:** 120 seconds (2 minutes, hard limit)

    **Solution:** Break long commands into smaller operations:
    ```bash
    # Instead of one long command, break into steps
    bash("step1")  # Completes in < 2min
    bash("step2")  # Completes in < 2min
    ```

    **Command not found:**
    - Check if command exists: `bash("which command-name")`
    - Ensure correct path or activate environment first
    - Use full paths for executables

    **Permission errors:**
    - Commands execute with user permissions
    - Check file/directory permissions
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Search Issues">
    ### Search Returning No Results

    **Issue:** grep_file or glob not finding expected files

    **Check pattern syntax:**
    ```bash
    # Wrong
    grep_file("*.ts")  # Missing ** for recursive

    # Correct
    grep_file("**/*.ts")  # Recursive search
    ```

    **Check exclusions:**
    ```bash
    # Ensure not accidentally excluding target files
    glob("**/*.js", exclude=["**/dist/**", "**/node_modules/**"])
    ```

    **Case sensitivity:**
    ```bash
    # Use case-insensitive search if needed
    grep_content("pattern", case_insensitive=true)
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configuration Issues

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="AGENTS.md Rules">
    ### AGENTS.md Not Applied

    **Problem:** Project rules not affecting Verdent behavior

    **Diagnostic:**
    1. **Location:** File must be in project root directory
    2. **Syntax:** Valid Markdown (check for syntax errors)
    3. **Specificity:** Rules must be directive: "Always use X" not "Try to use X"
    4. **Testing:** Start new conversation to test fresh application

    **Precedence check:**
    ```markdown
    # In AGENTS.md (highest priority)
    - Use 4-space indentation

    # In user_rules.md (lower priority)
    - Use 2-space indentation

    # Result: 4-space indentation (AGENTS.md wins)
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="MCP Connection">
    ### MCP Connection Failures

    **Error:** Cannot connect to MCP server

    **Diagnostic steps:**
    1. **Check mcp.json:** Valid JSON syntax in `~/.verdent/mcp.json`
    2. **Server running:** Ensure MCP server process is active
    3. **Network:** Verify connectivity to server endpoint
    4. **Authentication:** Confirm credentials are correct
    5. **Logs:** Check MCP server logs for error details

    **Common fixes:**
    - Restart MCP server
    - Verify connection string format
    - Check firewall rules allowing MCP traffic
    - Validate API keys or tokens
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Subagent Issues">
    ### Subagent Not Invoking

    **Problem:** Custom subagent doesn't activate automatically

    **Checklist:**
    - [ ] File location: `~/.verdent/subagents/[name].md`
    - [ ] Valid YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`
    - [ ] Invocation policy matches usage (strict requires @-mention)
    - [ ] "When to use" guidelines match request pattern
    - [ ] No syntax errors in markdown file

    **Test manually:**
    ```
    @subagent-name perform task
    ```

    <Tip>
    Use explicit @-mention to verify the subagent works before troubleshooting automatic invocation.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Built-in Subagents">
    ### Built-in Subagent Behavior

    **Issue:** @Explorer, @Verifier, or @Code-reviewer not behaving as expected

    **Common causes:**
    - Request does not match subagent's specialization
    - Subagent context full (rare)
    - Main conversation context affecting routing

    **Solution:**
    - Use explicit @-mention to force specific subagent
    - Rephrase request to match subagent expertise
    - Start fresh conversation if context is an issue
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Known Issues & Workarounds

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Binary Files">
    ### Binary File Limitations

    **Issue:** Cannot edit images, PDFs, compiled binaries

    **Workaround:**
    ```bash
    # Use bash to call external tools
    bash("convert input.png -resize 50% output.png")
    bash("pdftotext document.pdf output.txt")
    ```

    <Info>
    Binary file modifications require external tools invoked via bash commands.
    </Info>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Large Files">
    ### Large File Handling

    **Issue:** Files over 10,000 lines cause context issues

    **Workaround:**
    ```bash
    # Always use line ranges for large files
    file_read("large.log", start_line=1000, max_lines=100)

    # Search first to find relevant sections
    grep_content("ERROR", glob="large.log")
    ```

    <Tip>
    Search with grep_content first to locate relevant line numbers, then read only those specific ranges.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Platform Differences">
    ### Cross-Platform Command Differences

    **Issue:** bash commands differ between Windows and Unix

    **Workaround:**
    ```bash
    # Use cross-platform tools when possible
    bash("npm run build")  # Works everywhere

    # Or conditional execution
    bash("if [[ \"$OSTYPE\" == \"linux-gnu\"* ]]; then ...; fi")
    ```

    **Best practice:** Use npm scripts for cross-platform compatibility.
