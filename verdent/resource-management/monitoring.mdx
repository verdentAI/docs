description: "Monitor credit usage and manage resources in Verdent"
---

Verdent uses a credit-based system to manage computational resources. Understanding credit usage and monitoring helps you optimize costs effectively.

---

## Credit Monitoring

### Web Dashboard

Monitor your credit balance through **User Menu → Dashboard** or visit [verdent.ai/dashboard](https://verdent.ai/dashboard):

- Account name, current plan, and credit balance
- Total credits (subscription + top-ups) and remaining credits
- Detailed token consumption across sessions
- Usage patterns and trends
- Model selection impact
- Cost optimization opportunities

## Subscription Plans & Quotas

| Plan | Price | Credits/Month | Best For |
|------|-------|---------------|----------|
| **Free Trial** | Free | 100 (7 days) | New users |
| **Starter** | $19/month | 320 | Light users |
| **Pro** | $59/month | 1,000 | Regular users |
| **Max** | $179/month | 3,000 | Heavy users |

**Credit System:**
- Credits refresh monthly per billing cycle
- Consumption varies by model type
- Frontier models consume more credits

**Flexible Top-ups:** 240 ($20), 720 ($60), 960 ($80), 1,200 ($100), or 2,400 credits ($200)

<Tip>
Credits are shared across Verdent VS Code and Desktop, enabling seamless workflow between platforms.

## Parallel Agent Usage

Each workspace with an active task consumes credits independently:

| Active Workspaces | Credit Usage |
|-------------------|--------------|
| 1 workspace | 1x baseline |
| 2 workspaces | 2x baseline |
| 3 workspaces | 3x baseline |

**To optimize parallel usage:**
- Complete and rebase workspaces promptly
- Delete workspaces when done
- Idle workspaces (no active conversation) don't consume credits

---

## Managing Long-Running Tasks

**Quick Tips:**
- Use Plan Mode to understand scope before execution
- Start fresh tasks between major work to reset context
- Complete atomic work units (feature → test → commit)
- Watch for slower responses as sessions grow longer

## FAQs

<Accordion title="Why are my credits depleting faster than expected?">
Common causes:
- **Multiple parallel workspaces** - Each active workspace uses credits independently
- **Large context** - Long conversations use more tokens
- **Frontier models** - Higher cost than efficient models

Check your active workspace count in **All Workspaces**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do idle workspaces consume credits?">
No. Workspaces with no active conversation don't consume credits. Credits are only used when making AI requests.
