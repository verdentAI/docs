description: Controlling Verdent's behavior through rule files
---

Rule files are Markdown documents that define how Verdent behaves during coding sessions. They guide the AI agent's behavior, output formatting, and adherence to project standards.

### What You'll Learn

- Understanding user rules and project rules
- When to use each rule type
- Writing effective rules

---

## Rule Types

| Rule Type | File | Scope | Purpose |
|-----------|------|-------|---------|
| **User Rules** | user_rules.md | Global (all projects) | Personal coding preferences |
| **Project Rules** | AGENTS.md | Current project | Team conventions, project standards |

**Precedence:** AGENTS.md (highest) → user_rules.md (medium) → defaults (lowest)

---

## User Rules (user_rules.md)

User rules define global preferences that apply across all projects.

**Access:** Settings → User Rules

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Use Cases">
    - **Coding style:** Indentation, naming conventions
    - **Language:** Response language preferences
    - **Comments:** Comment style and detail level
    - **Communication:** Tone and verbosity
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Example">
    ```markdown
    # User Rules

    ## Code Style
    - Use TypeScript strict mode
    - Prefer functional components in React
    - Use 2-space indentation

    ## Communication
    - Provide brief explanations
    - Show code first, explain after
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Project Rules (AGENTS.md)

Project rules define standards specific to the current project. Store in the project root and commit to version control for team-wide sharing.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Use Cases">
    - **Team conventions:** Shared coding standards
    - **Architecture:** Design patterns, state management
    - **Testing:** Coverage requirements, frameworks
    - **Workflows:** Build commands, PR guidelines
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Example">
    ```markdown
    # AGENTS.md

    ## Dev Environment
    - Run `pnpm install` to set up
    - Use `pnpm dev` for local development

    ## Testing
    - Run `pnpm test` before committing
    - Minimum 80% coverage required

    ## PR Guidelines
    - Use conventional commit format
    - Include tests for new features
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
Share AGENTS.md with your team via version control to ensure consistent AI behavior across all team members.
</Tip>

## Rule Precedence

When rules conflict, project rules override user rules:

```
user_rules.md: "Use 2-space indentation"
AGENTS.md: "Use 4-space indentation for this project"
→ Result: 4-space indentation (project rules win)
```

## Writing Effective Rules

**Be Specific:**
```markdown
# Good
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Include JSDoc comments for exported functions

# Avoid
- Try to use modern JavaScript features
- Add comments when necessary
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use clear, directive language ("Always...", "Never...", "Prefer...")
- Group related rules under section headers
- Keep rules concise (one concept per bullet)
- Review and update rules as project evolves

## FAQs

<Accordion title="How do I create rule files?">
Create `user_rules.md` for personal preferences and `AGENTS.md` in your project root for project-specific rules. Use plain Markdown with bullet points.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When do rule changes take effect?">
Rule changes apply immediately in new conversations and influence current conversation responses.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I override project rules temporarily?">
Project rules take precedence, but you can provide specific instructions in your prompt to override for a single request.
</Accordion>
