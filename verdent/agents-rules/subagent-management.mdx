title: Subagent Management
description: Understanding and managing subagents in Verdent
---

Subagents are specialized AI agents that operate with their own custom system prompt and isolated context window. They handle specific tasks delegated by the main agent without polluting the main conversation context.

### What You'll Learn

- Understanding default subagents
- Creating custom subagents
- Managing subagent configurations
- Manual invocation with @-mentions

---

## Key Characteristics

- **Isolated Context:** Each subagent maintains its own separate context window
- **Custom System Prompts:** Every subagent has a dedicated system prompt defining its behavior
- **Manual Invocation:** Users can explicitly reference subagents using @-mentions (e.g., `@verifier`)

---

## Default Subagents

Verdent includes a built-in subagent that is pre-configured and immediately available.

### @verifier

**Specialization:** Quick code checks and validation

**Capabilities:**
- Validates code logic
- Checks syntax correctness
- Verifies implementation against requirements

**Usage:**
```
@verifier check this authentication logic
```

**Best For:** Rapid validation without full code review overhead

<Tip>
@verifier can be configured to use a different model in Settings. Use a smaller, cheaper model for simple verification tasks.

## Creating Custom Subagents

Create specialized subagents tailored to your workflow.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Settings">
    Open Settings → Subagents
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Subagent">
    Click **Add Subagent**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure">
    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **Name** | Identifier for @-mention invocation |
    | **Description** | Brief explanation of purpose |
    | **Prompt** | Custom system instructions |
    | **Model** | Sonnet 4.5, GPT-5, GPT-5-Codex, or Haiku 4.5 |
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Subagents

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Enable/Disable** | Toggle subagent availability |
| **Duplicate** | Create a copy with existing settings |
| **Edit** | Modify any configuration |
| **Delete** | Remove the subagent |

---

## Using Subagents

### Manual Invocation

Use @-mentions to explicitly invoke a subagent:

```
@verifier check validation logic in middleware
```

**Benefits of Manual Invocation:**
- **Precision:** Ensure exact subagent handles the task
- **Control:** Choose specific subagent when multiple could apply
- **Consistency:** Repeat tasks with same subagent for consistent results

### When to Use @verifier

| Task Type | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Quick validation | `@verifier check this logic` |
| Syntax check | `@verifier validate this function` |
| Implementation check | `@verifier verify this matches requirements` |

## Subagent vs Main Agent

| Aspect | Subagent | Main Agent |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Context** | Isolated, focused | Full conversation context |
| **Speed** | Faster for specific tasks | Better for complex analysis |
| **Best for** | Validation, review | Investigation, implementation |

## FAQs

<Accordion title="When should I use a subagent instead of the main agent?">
Use subagents for quick, focused tasks like validation or code review. Use the main agent for complex investigations requiring full context.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do subagents share context with the main agent?">
No. Subagents have isolated context windows. Only the final results are returned to the main agent.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I configure subagent models?">
Yes. @verifier can be configured to use a different model in Settings for cost optimization.
</Accordion>
