title: Workspace Isolation
description: "Git worktree-based isolation for parallel experimentation without conflicts"
---

Workspace Isolation is Verdent's system for ensuring parallel work never interferes with itself. Each workspace is a completely separate working environment, isolated at the filesystem level using git worktrees.

## What You'll Learn

- How workspace isolation prevents conflicts
- How git worktrees enable isolation
- Difference between Base Workspace and Workspaces
- Creating, switching, and managing workspaces
- Best practices for workspace management

## What is Workspace Isolation?

Workspace Isolation ensures that changes from one task never affect another. Try different approaches in parallel, compare results, and selectively rebase only the changes you want back into the main branch.

### How It Works

| Layer | How It Works |
|-------|--------------|
| **Directory** | Each workspace is an isolated directory |
| **Branch** | Each workspace has its own branch checkout |
| **Files** | File changes in one workspace don't affect others |
| **Staging** | Each workspace has its own staging area |

## Base Workspace vs Workspaces

### Base Workspace

The Base workspace is your original repository checkout, serving as the default starting point.

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Location** | Your original git clone or init location |
| **Primary Branch** | Typically on master or development branch |
| **Reference Point** | Source for comparing experimental work |

**When to Use Base:**
- Quick changes that don't need isolation
- Reference point for comparing experimental work
- When you want changes to go directly to the main branch
- Simple tasks where parallel execution isn't needed

### Workspace

A Workspace is an isolated working environment created using git worktrees, with its own independent branch checkout and file state.

**When to Use a Workspace:**
- Parallel feature development
- Experimenting with risky changes
- Working on multiple tasks simultaneously
- When you want isolation before rebasing

## Creating and Managing Workspaces

### Creating a New Workspace

| Platform | Shortcut |
|----------|----------|
| **macOS** | `Cmd+Shift+N` |
| **Windows** | `Ctrl+Shift+N` |

**What Happens:**
1. Verdent creates an isolated git worktree directory
2. A new branch is created (or existing branch checked out)
3. The workspace is fully isolated from other workspaces
4. Workspace appears in **All Workspaces** in the top bar

### Switching Between Workspaces

| Action | macOS | Windows |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| **Next Workspace** | `Ctrl+Tab` | `Ctrl+Tab` |
| **Previous Workspace** | `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` | `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` |
| **Select Workspace** | Click **All Workspaces** in the top bar | Click **All Workspaces** in the top bar |

**State Preservation:**
- Verdent keeps all workspace states alive
- Switch instantly without setup delay
- Full context preserved when switching

## Rebasing Workspace Changes

When you're ready to integrate workspace changes back to the main branch:

### Using Verdent UI

<Steps>
  <Step title="Complete Work">
    Complete work in the workspace
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Changes">
    Click **Task Changes** in the middle panel to review all modifications
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rebase to main branch">
    Click **Workspace Actions → Rebase to main branch** in the Workspace Bar
  </Step>
  <Step title="Resolve Conflicts">
    Resolve any conflicts if prompted
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify">
    Review changes before confirming
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Keeping Workspaces Updated

Use **Workspace Actions → Sync with main branch** to pull the latest changes from the main branch into your workspace. This helps prevent large conflicts when rebasing.

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

| Practice | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Descriptive names | `feature-auth`, `bugfix-123`, `experiment-caching` |
| Include ticket numbers | `JIRA-456-user-login` |
| Keep names short | Avoid overly long names |

### Workspace Maintenance

| Practice | Why |
|----------|-----|
| **Delete rebased workspaces** | Free up disk space |
| **Remove abandoned experiments** | Keep workspace list manageable |
| **Keep workspace count reasonable** | System resources are finite |

### Git Hygiene

| Practice | Why |
|----------|-----|
| **Commit frequently** | Commit work in progress before switching |
| **Small commits** | Smaller commits are easier to cherry-pick |
| **Sync with base regularly** | Don't let workspaces diverge too far from the main branch |
| **Reduce conflict complexity** | Regular integration prevents large conflicts |

## FAQs

<Accordion title="How much disk space does each workspace use?">
Each workspace duplicates working files but shares the `.git` directory. Space usage roughly equals your project size per workspace. Large projects with many parallel workspaces will use significant disk space.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I delete a workspace?">
Yes. Delete the workspace through Verdent. This removes the directory but preserves any committed work on the branch.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens to uncommitted changes if I delete a workspace?">
Uncommitted changes are lost when a workspace is deleted. Always commit or stash changes before removing a workspace.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I convert a workspace to the base workspace?">
No direct conversion, but you can rebase all changes from the workspace to the main branch, then delete the workspace. The branch history is preserved.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do worktrees work with all git hosting services?">
Yes. Git worktrees are a standard git feature. They work with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and any other git hosting service.
</Accordion>
