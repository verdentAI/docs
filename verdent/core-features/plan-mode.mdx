description: "Transform ideas into robust implementation plans with intelligent requirement clarification"
---

In Plan Mode, Verdent transforms informal ideas into implementation plans through structured requirement clarification. Collaborative dialogue and iterative refinement ensure alignment before implementation begins.

### What You'll Learn

- Intelligent requirement clarification
- Plan generation
- Clarification Loop interactions

## Intelligent Requirement Clarification

Verdent engages as a technical partner:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Exploratory Dialogue">
    Multi-turn conversations to uncover implicit requirements:

    - Edge case identification and technical constraint discovery
    - Proactive ambiguity resolution before implementation
    - Iterative refinement through collaborative discussion
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Domain Expertise">
    Applies software engineering best practices:

    - Suggests optimal approaches, design patterns, and technology choices
    - Presents trade-off analysis with pros/cons for informed decision-making
    - Recommends industry-standard solutions and frameworks
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Convenient Interaction">
    Supports convenient clarification interactions:

    - Modifying clarification options
    - Additional information and context
    - Skipping clarifications
    - Rolling back changes and resubmit
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Clarification Loop

In Plan Mode, Verdent asks clarifying questions through an interactive questionnaire, allowing collaborative requirement confirmation before implementation.

- **Multiple choice** - Select from predefined answer options
- **Custom answers** - Craft your own answer when choices don't fit
- **Mixed approach** - Select an option and add custom clarification

### Refinement Controls

Available interactions during the clarification loop:

- **Modify Options** - Adjust the multiple choice options presented to better match your context
- **Skip Clarifications** - Proceed with Verdent's best judgment when requirements are clear enough
- **Rollback Changes** - Revert to previous clarification state and resubmit different answers

## Plan Generation

Verdent generates developer-ready plans that include:

- High-level summary of goals, scope, and success criteria
- Component structure and relationships
- Data models and API contracts
- Technology stack considerations

## FAQs

<Accordion title="How do I switch to Plan Mode?">
Press `Shift+Tab` or `Ctrl+.` to toggle between Plan Mode and Agent Mode. You can also click the Switch Mode button in the input box.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When should I use Plan Mode instead of Agent Mode?">
Use Plan Mode for complex features, architectural decisions, or when you want to review the approach before implementation. Use Agent Mode for straightforward tasks.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I skip the clarification questions?">
Yes. Use the Skip Clarifications option to proceed with Verdent's best judgment when requirements are clear enough.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Will my plan be saved?">
Ask Verdent to save the plan as a markdown file for future reference.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I modify a plan before executing?">
You can ask Verdent to revise the plan in Plan Mode. Once satisfied, switch to Agent Mode to execute.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does Plan Mode use credits?">
Yes. Plan Mode operations consume credits based on the model used and tokens processed, similar to Agent Mode.
