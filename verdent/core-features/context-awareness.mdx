title: Context Awareness
description: "Intelligent tracking of code, task, and conversation context"
---

Context Awareness is Verdent's ability to keep track of code, tasks, and conversation context while understanding dependencies across your project. With up to 1M token capacity, Verdent comprehends entire medium-sized codebases.

---

## What You'll Learn

- Understanding context windows (200K vs 1M)
- How Verdent tracks dependencies
- Context isolation across parallel tasks
- Recognizing and resetting context overload

## Understanding Context Windows

Verdent's context window size depends on the model being used.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Standard Models (200K)">
    Most models use standard `200K` context windows:
    - **Claude Sonnet 4.5** - Balanced for complex tasks
    - **Claude Haiku 4.5** - Fast and efficient
    - **GPT-5 (Beta)** - Excellent for reasoning
    - **GPT-5-Codex (Beta)** - Optimized for coding
    - **Gemini 3 Pro** - Advanced reasoning and multimodal
    - **Kimi K2 Series** - Lightning-fast for coding

    **Capacity:**
    - ~`200,000` tokens of total memory capacity
    - Sufficient for most development tasks and medium-sized projects

    **What's Included:**
    - All messages in conversation
    - File contents loaded into context
    - Tool outputs and responses
    - System prompts and instructions
    - MCP server definitions

    **Performance:**
    - Degrades significantly when approaching limits
    - Watch for signs of context overload (slower responses, less accurate outputs)
    - Reset context more frequently for optimal performance
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Extended Context (1M)">
    Claude Sonnet 4.5 1M offers extended context (`1M` tokens) for long or complex tasks exceeding `200K` input.

    **Capacity:**
    - `1,000,000` tokens of total memory
    - 5x larger than standard models

    **Benefits:**
    - Perfect for loading entire large codebases without chunking
    - Eliminates most context management concerns for big projects
    - Work longer before hitting context limits
    - Fewer session resets needed

    **When to Use:**
    - Large codebases with 1000+ files
    - Complex multi-file refactoring across entire projects
    - Long development sessions spanning multiple related tasks
    - When you want to minimize context management overhead

## What Verdent Tracks

| Context Type | What's Preserved |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Code Context** | File contents, structure, coding patterns, file relationships |
| **Task Context** | Current goals, progress, decisions made, conversation history |
| **Dependency Context** | Imports, exports, function calls, configuration references |

---

## Understanding Dependencies

### How Verdent Tracks Dependencies

Verdent understands how files in your project relate to each other:

| Relationship | Example |
|--------------|---------|
| **Imports** | `import { UserService } from './services'` |
| **Exports** | `export class UserController` |
| **References** | Function calls, class instantiation |
| **Configuration** | Config files referenced by multiple modules |

---

## Context Across Parallel Tasks

### How Context Works in Parallel Execution

When running multiple agents in parallel, each maintains independent context:

| Aspect | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Per-Workspace Context** | Each workspace has separate context |
| **Per-Task Context** | Each task has its own conversation context |
| **No Cross-Contamination** | Parallel agents don't share context |
| **Project-Level Awareness** | All agents can understand project structure |

### Switching Tasks

When you switch between tasks:

| What Happens | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Context Preserved** | Each task's context remains intact |
| **No Confusion** | Contexts don't mix between tasks |

---

## Recognizing Context Overload

| Symptom | Signs |
|---------|-------|
| **Response Quality** | Less accurate responses, missing details, inconsistent outputs |
| **Speed Issues** | Slower responses, longer processing delays |
| **Behavioral Changes** | Forgetting earlier context, redundant questions |
| **Technical** | Sessions running for several hours, or 20+ large files (>1000 lines each) loaded |

<Warning>
If Verdent's responses become vague or repetitive, context overload may be occurring. Reset the conversation to restore full performance.
</Warning>

---

## When to Reset Context

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Performance degrades** | Start fresh session when quality drops |
| **Task transitions** | New session for unrelated features or modules |
| **After commits** | Commit → test → new session |
| **Long sessions** | Proactively reset before context degrades |

**Best Practice:** Complete atomic unit of work → test → commit → clear context → start fresh.

---

## Best Practices

| Practice | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| **Use @-mentions** | Direct Verdent to specific files (`@filename`, `@folder/`) |
| **Be specific about scope** | Limits context to relevant areas |
| **Focus on specific modules** | Better performance on large codebases |

## FAQs

<Accordion title="Which model should I choose for my project?">
For most projects, Claude Sonnet 4.5 (200K) is sufficient. For large codebases or long development sessions, use Claude Sonnet 4.5 1M for extended context.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does 1M context cost more credits?">
Yes. Extended context models have higher credit consumption than standard 200K models.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I reset context?">
Start a new task to reset context. Your previous task remains accessible in the task list.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Will I lose my work if I reset context?">
No. File changes are saved to your workspace. Only conversation context resets.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I see how much context I've used?">
Yes. The Context Remaining indicator in the middle panel shows remaining capacity for the current conversation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does context persist between sessions?">
Yes. Task history persists between sessions. You can resume tasks where you left off when you reopen Verdent.
</Accordion>
