title: Agent Mode
description: "Agentic task execution with full transparency into every action"
---

Agent Mode is Verdent's default execution mode where the agent takes direct action on your instructions. Rather than structured planning sessions, Agent Mode prioritizes quick execution while maintaining full transparency.

### What You'll Learn

- When Agent Mode is the right choice
- How the execution workflow operates
- Managing permissions and visibility

## When Agent Mode is Useful

Agent Mode works best when you have clarity on what needs to be done:

| Scenario | Situation | How Verdent Helps |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Clear Requirements** | You know exactly what you want implemented. The task is well-defined with a specific outcome. | Agent proceeds directly with implementation. No planning overhead, just results. |
| **Quick Iterations** | You're in a rapid feedback loop, making incremental changes based on results. | Fast execution cycles let you see changes immediately and adjust course. |
| **Straightforward Tasks** | Bug fixes, small features, code cleanup, or refactoring with obvious scope. | Agent completes the work efficiently without unnecessary back-and-forth. |

## Agent Mode Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Submit Your Request">
    Describe what you want done. Clear, specific instructions work best in Agent Mode.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent Takes Action">
    Verdent begins implementation immediately. File edits, tool usage, and progress appear in real-time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Permission Prompts">
    Certain actions require approval. Review and approve to proceed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="See Results">
    Work completes with full visibility into what changed and why.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Characteristics

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Default Mode** | New tasks start in Agent Mode unless you switch to Plan Mode |
| **Direct Action** | Agent proceeds with implementation rather than extensive planning |
| **Full Visibility** | File edits, tool usage, and progress are shown in real-time |
| **Inline Clarification** | Questions appear naturally in the chat, not as structured questionnaires |

## Agent Mode vs Plan Mode

Choose based on task clarity and complexity:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Use Agent Mode When">
    Agent Mode is optimal for:

    - Clear, well-defined requirements
    - Straightforward implementation tasks
    - Quick iterations and feedback loops
    - Tasks where you're confident in the approach
    - Bug fixes and small features
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Use Plan Mode When">
    Switch to Plan Mode for:

    - Complex multi-step features
    - Incomplete or evolving ideas
    - Architectural decisions
    - Tasks requiring exploration before implementation
    - When you want structured requirement clarification
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Permissions in Agent Mode

Agent Mode executes tasks directly, but certain actions still require explicit approval:

- File modifications outside expected scope
- Destructive operations
- Certain tool executions
- Actions with significant side effects

<Note>
Permission prompts protect against unintended changes while maintaining execution speed for routine operations.
</Note>

## FAQs

<Accordion title="Is Agent Mode the default?">
Yes. New tasks start in Agent Mode. Switch to Plan Mode when you need structured planning.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Will the agent ask questions in Agent Mode?">
Yes, when needed. Questions appear inline in the chat rather than as structured questionnaires. The agent may proceed without asking if the task is sufficiently clear.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I switch to Plan Mode?">
Press `Shift+Tab` or `Cmd+.` to toggle modes. Mode switching is available at certain points, not during active execution.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does Agent Mode skip all confirmation?">
No. Certain actions still require approval. Agent Mode reduces friction for routine operations while maintaining safety for significant changes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When should I use Plan Mode instead?">
Use Plan Mode for complex features, architectural decisions, or when you want to explore and refine requirements before implementation begins.
</Accordion>
