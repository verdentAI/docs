title: Overview
description: "Discover Verdent's parallel multi-agent execution with isolated workspaces"
---

Verdent is an AI-powered development environment designed for real development workflows where you're rarely working on a single task. Run multiple AI agents simultaneously across isolated workspaces, delivering production-ready code even when you're away.

### What You'll Learn

- Core workflow capabilities (Parallel Agents, Workspace Isolation, Plan Mode)
- Context awareness and specialized sub-agents
- Collaboration modes and extensibility

---

Verdent's workflow is built around three core phases:

- **Execute** - Run multiple agents in parallel across isolated workspaces
- **Isolate** - Each agent works in its own workspace with full file isolation
- **Review** - Compare and rebase results

These features work together to enable parallel development with full control.

## Additional Capabilities

### Context Awareness: Deep Codebase Understanding

Verdent's context management system enables comprehensive project comprehension:

#### Massive Context Window

- **Up to 1M Token Capacity** - Standard models support 200K tokens; Claude Sonnet 4.5 1M extends to 1M for larger codebases
- **Smart Context Loading** - Automatically prioritizes relevant files based on task context
- **Sub-Agent Context Optimization** - Delegates specialized tasks to focused sub-agents

#### Adaptive Learning

- **Convention Detection** - Learns project-specific patterns (naming, file organization, error handling)
- **Style Mimicry** - Generates code matching existing style (indentation, brace placement, comments)
- **Library Awareness** - Recognizes frameworks in use, preferring them over new dependencies

#### Cross-File Coherence

- **Dependency Tracking** - Understands imports, exports, and module relationships
- **Impact Prediction** - Identifies components affected by proposed changes
- **Consistency Enforcement** - Ensures modifications align with existing architecture

### Specialized Sub-Agents: Division of Labor

Verdent orchestrates specialized AI agents optimized for specific development tasks:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Verifier Agent">
    **Purpose:** Rapid code quality checks and validation

    **Capabilities:**

    - **Lint Checks** - ESLint, Pylint, Rubocop, etc.
    - **Type Validation** - TypeScript, mypy, Flow type checking
    - **Fast Test Execution** - Targeted unit tests with under 30s budget
    - **Diff-Focused Verification** - Validate only changed code for efficiency

    **Fail-Fast Philosophy:** Returns structured error reports on first real issue, avoiding time waste

    **Use Cases:** Pre-commit checks, post-fix validation, quick sanity tests
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Code Reviewer Agent">
    **Purpose:** Comprehensive code quality, security, and maintainability audits

    **Capabilities:**

    - **Security Analysis** - Vulnerability scanning, credential exposure detection, injection risk assessment
    - **Architecture Review** - Design pattern validation, SOLID principle adherence, anti-pattern detection
    - **Performance Analysis** - Algorithmic complexity, resource leaks, optimization opportunities
    - **Documentation Completeness** - Comment quality, API documentation, README accuracy

    **Review Depth:** More thorough than Verifier, suitable for pre-merge PR reviews

    **Use Cases:** Feature completion review, security audit, refactoring validation
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Flexible Collaboration Modes

Choose the level of autonomy that fits your workflow:

- **Agent Mode** - Executes tasks autonomously with full file modifications and command execution
- **Plan Mode** - Read-only mode for analysis and planning without file modifications

See [Execution Modes & Permissions](/verdent/execution-modes/overview) for detailed mode documentation.

---

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration

Enables interoperability with external tools and services:

- Extends functionality through existing toolchains and custom plugins
- Works seamlessly with sub-agents to support distributed task execution
- Supports integration with external APIs, databases, and development tools

See [MCP Integration](/verdent/core-features/mcp-integration) for setup and configuration.
