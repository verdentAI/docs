Effective context management ensures Verdent has the right information at the right time while avoiding performance degradation from context overload.

### What You'll Learn

- Understanding context windows and their limits
- Selecting files strategically for optimal context
- Recognizing and responding to context overload
- When to reset context for better performance

## Understanding Context Windows

Verdent's context window size depends on the model being used.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Standard (200K)">
    Most models use standard 200K context windows:
    - **Claude Sonnet 4.5** - Balanced for complex tasks
    - **Claude Haiku** - Fast and efficient
    - **GPT-5** - Reasoning tasks (Beta)
    - **GPT-5-Codex** - Code generation (Beta)

    **Capacity:**
    - ~200,000 tokens of total memory
    - Sufficient for most development tasks

    **What's Included:**
    - All messages in conversation
    - File contents loaded into context
    - Tool outputs and responses
    - System prompts and instructions
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Extended (1M)">
    Claude Sonnet 4.5 1M offers extended context when input exceeds 200K tokens.

    **Capacity:**
    - 1,000,000 tokens of total memory
    - 5x larger than standard models

    **When to Use:**
    - Large codebases with 1000+ files
    - Complex multi-file refactoring
    - Long development sessions
    - When you want to minimize context management overhead
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Strategic File Selection

Be strategic about file selection to optimize context usage.

<Tip>
Start with fewer files and add more only when needed—Verdent can always read additional files during the conversation.
</Tip>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="@-Mentions">
    Use @-mentions for explicit file inclusion:

    ```
    @filename.js
    ```

    Verdent auto-loads related files, but @-mentions ensure precise control. Only include files directly relevant to the current task.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Best Practices">
    - Include only files that need to be modified or referenced
    - Reference existing patterns instead of loading example files
    - For large codebases, work on one module at a time
    - Let Verdent read files as needed rather than preloading
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Recognizing Context Overload

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Response Quality">
    **Signs:**
    - Less accurate or incomplete responses
    - Missing important details from earlier in conversation
    - Confused about recent changes or context

    **Action:** Start a fresh task when quality degrades
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Speed Issues">
    **Signs:**
    - Noticeably slower response times
    - Longer processing delays

    **Action:** Consider starting a new task
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Behavioral Changes">
    **Signs:**
    - Requests to clarify information already provided
    - Forgetting patterns established earlier
    - Redundant questions about project structure

    **Action:** Reset context by starting a new task
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
If Verdent's responses become vague or repetitive, context overload may be occurring. Start a new task to restore full performance.
</Warning>

## When to Reset Context

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Performance Issues">
    - Noticeably slower response times
    - Less accurate or inconsistent responses
    - Verdent forgetting earlier context

    **Action:** Start fresh task when quality degrades
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Task Transitions">
    - Switching between unrelated features
    - After completing one task and moving to next
    - After memory-intensive tasks (large refactorings)

    **Action:** New task for new major work
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="After Commits">
    - After committing completed features
    - Between logical checkpoints
    - Following test-verify-commit cycles

    **Action:** Commit → test → new task
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Best Practice:** Complete atomic unit of work → test → commit → start fresh task.
