description: "Git integration and version control in Verdent"
---

Verdent manages Git automatically through workspace isolation. Each workspace operates on its own branch, with changes rebased to master when complete.

## What You'll Learn

- Use Source Control for staging and commits
- How Verdent handles Git operations
- Rebasing changes to master

---

## Source Control Panel

For manual Git operations, use the **Source Control** panel (`Ctrl+Shift+G` / `Cmd+Shift+G`):

- View changed files
- Stage and unstage changes
- Commit with custom messages
- Diff view for individual files
- Revert changes

---

## Git Through Verdent

Ask Verdent to handle Git operations naturally:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Commits">
    ```
    Commit these changes with message "Add user authentication"
    ```

    ```
    Commit current changes as work-in-progress
    ```

    Verdent reviews changed files, generates a descriptive message, and executes the commit.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="History">
    ```
    Show me the last 10 commits
    ```

    ```
    What changed in the last commit?
    ```

    ```
    Show me the diff between master and this branch
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Branches">
    ```
    Create a new branch called feature-login
    ```

    ```
    Sync this branch with the latest changes from master
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Workspace Operations

Each workspace has its own Git branch. Use **Workspace Actions** in the Top Bar:

| Operation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **Sync with master** | Pull latest changes from master into workspace |
| **Rebase to master** | Apply workspace changes to master |

### Rebase Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Complete Work">
    Finish your feature or fix in the workspace
  </Step>
  <Step title="Commit Changes">
    Use Source Control (`Ctrl+Shift+G`) to stage changes and commit with a descriptive message
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test">
    Run tests to ensure everything works
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rebase">
    Click **Workspace Actions → Rebase to master**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clean Up">
    Click **Delete Workspace** in the Workspace Bar
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Terminal Access (Optional)

For advanced Git operations, use the integrated terminal (`Ctrl+J`):

<Accordion title="Common terminal commands">
```bash
# Status and diff
git status
git diff

# History
git log --oneline -10

# Reset uncommitted changes
git checkout -- .

# Reset to previous commit (destructive)
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```
</Accordion>

## FAQs

<Accordion title="What happens to uncommitted changes when switching workspaces?">
Each workspace maintains its own state. Uncommitted changes in one workspace don't affect others.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I resolve conflicts when syncing?">
1. Click **Workspace Actions → Sync with master**
2. Conflicts appear in affected files
3. Ask Verdent to help: `Help me resolve the conflicts in @userService.ts`
4. Stage resolved files and complete the sync
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why does Verdent use rebase instead of merge?">
Rebase creates cleaner linear history and easier code review. Each workspace produces a clean branch that rebases onto master when complete.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I push workspace branches to remote?">
Yes. Each workspace branch is a normal Git branch. Use `git push origin branch-name` for backup, code review, or collaboration.
</Accordion>
