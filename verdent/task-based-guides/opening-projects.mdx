## Opening a Project

From the **Home** screen, select a project directory to open.

If your project isn't already a git repository, Verdent creates one automatically for tracking changes and enabling workspace isolation.

<Note>
Git 2.20+ is required for worktree support. See [Git Installation](/verdent/getting-started/git-installation) for setup help.
</Note>

## Switching Projects

Click **Current Project** in the Top Bar to:
- Switch to another open project
- Access recent projects

When switching projects, all workspace states, task conversations, and running agents are preserved.

## Base Workspace

Each project has a **Base** workspace (your original checkout on the main branch) and optional worktree workspaces for isolated work.

| Workspace Type | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Base** | Original git checkout, typically on master branch |
| **Worktree** | Isolated workspace created for specific tasks |

Git state (commits, branches) is preserved as normal. Task history persists between sessions.
