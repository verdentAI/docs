## Debugging with Verdent

### Basic Debugging Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe the Bug">
    In the input box, describe the issue and symptoms you're seeing
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verdent Investigates">
    Verdent reads relevant files and analyzes the code to find the root cause
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the Fix">
    Verdent proposes and implements the fix, then shows the changes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify">
    Verdent runs tests to confirm the fix works
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Terminal (Optional)

For manual debugging or when you need direct command access:

- Press `Ctrl+J` or `` Ctrl+` `` to toggle the terminal panel
- Terminal opens in the current workspace's root directory

<Accordion title="Common terminal debugging commands">
```bash
# Run tests
npm test
pytest
go test ./...

# Run tests with verbose output
npm test -- --verbose
pytest -v

# Run specific test file
npm test -- src/auth.test.ts
pytest tests/test_auth.py

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
pytest --cov=src
```
</Accordion>

## Using @Verifier

The `@Verifier` subagent specializes in rapid validation and verification tasks.

### When to Use @Verifier

| Task | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Quick checks** | `@Verifier check if auth middleware handles expired tokens` |
| **Validation** | `@Verifier validate the error handling in @userService.ts` |
| **Syntax verification** | `@Verifier check this SQL query for syntax errors` |
| **Pre-commit checks** | `@Verifier verify the changes are ready for commit` |

### @Verifier Examples

**Check specific functionality:**
```
@Verifier verify that the login function properly handles:
- Invalid credentials
- Locked accounts
- Missing required fields
```

**Validate after changes:**
```
@Verifier run the tests for the auth module and summarize any failures
```

**Quick sanity check:**
```
@Verifier is the database connection being properly closed in @dbClient.ts?
```

### @Verifier vs Main Agent

| Aspect | @Verifier | Main Agent |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Context** | Isolated, focused | Full conversation context |
| **Speed** | Faster for quick checks | Better for complex analysis |
| **Best for** | Validation, verification | Investigation, fixing |
| **Cost** | Separate context (efficient) | Main context usage |

<Tip>
@Verifier can be configured to use a different model in Settings. Use a smaller, cheaper model for simple verification tasks to reduce credit usage.
</Tip>

## Debugging Workflows

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Error Messages">
    Investigate error messages systematically:

    **Prompt template:**
    ```
    I'm seeing this error: [paste error message]
    It occurs when [describe when/how it happens]

    Help me understand what's causing it and how to fix it.
    ```

    **Verdent will:**
    1. Analyze the error message
    2. Search for relevant code
    3. Identify the root cause
    4. Propose a fix
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Test Failures">
    Debug failing tests:

    **Prompt template:**
    ```
    The test @tests/auth.test.ts is failing on line 45.
    The test expects [expected behavior] but gets [actual behavior].
    ```

    **Verdent will:**
    1. Read the test file
    2. Analyze what's being tested
    3. Check the implementation
    4. Identify the discrepancy
    5. Propose fix (to test or implementation)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Performance">
    Profile and optimize slow code:

    **Prompt template:**
    ```
    The @processOrders function is running slowly.
    Profile and suggest optimizations.
    ```

    **Verdent may:**
    - Add timing logs
    - Run profiling commands
    - Identify bottlenecks
    - Suggest optimizations
  </Tab>

## Desktop Debugging Features

### Parallel Debugging

Debug multiple issues simultaneously in separate workspaces:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Multiple Bugs">
    Debug unrelated bugs in parallel without interference:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create Debug Workspace">
        Click **New Workspace** in the Top Bar for your first bug
      </Step>
      <Step title="Name the Workspace">
        Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "debug-auth-bug")
      </Step>
      <Step title="Describe the Bug">
        In the input box, describe the bug and ask Verdent to investigate
      </Step>
      <Step title="Create Additional Workspaces">
        Repeat for each additional bug you want to debug
      </Step>
      <Step title="Compare Results">
        Switch between workspaces using **All Workspaces** to compare behavior
      </Step>
      <Step title="Apply Fixes">
        When a fix is ready, click **Workspace Actions → Rebase to master**
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    **Benefit:** Each debug effort is isolated with no interference between sessions.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Compare Against Stable">
    Debug while keeping a stable reference:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Keep Base Workspace Stable">
        Your base workspace stays on master with working code
      </Step>
      <Step title="Create Debug Workspace">
        Click **New Workspace** for your debug investigation
      </Step>
      <Step title="Investigate the Bug">
        Let Verdent add logging, make changes, and test fixes
      </Step>
      <Step title="Compare Behavior">
        Run tests in both workspaces to compare results
      </Step>
      <Step title="Apply or Discard">
        Rebase the fix if successful, or delete the workspace to discard
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    **Benefit:** Always have stable code to compare against during investigation.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Reviewing Bug Fixes

After Verdent makes a fix:

1. Click **Task Changes** in the middle panel to review changes
2. Verify the fix addresses the root cause
3. Check for unintended side effects
4. Request modifications in the input box if needed

### Plan Mode for Complex Bugs

For difficult-to-understand bugs:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Switch to Plan Mode">
    Press `Shift+Tab` or `Ctrl+.` to switch to Plan Mode
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe the Bug">
    In the input box, describe the bug in detail:
    ```
    I have a race condition in the order processing system.
    Sometimes orders are processed twice.
    Help me understand what's happening and plan a fix.
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Analysis">
    Verdent analyzes code and creates an investigation plan
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute Investigation">

## FAQs

<Accordion title="How do I debug intermittent bugs?">
1. Add logging to capture state when bug occurs
2. Request Verdent to add strategic log statements
3. Reproduce multiple times to find pattern
4. Use `@Verifier` to validate fixes don't introduce regressions
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Should I use a separate workspace for debugging?">
**Yes, for:**
- Bugs that might require significant changes
- When you want to compare against master
- Long debugging sessions

**No, for:**
- Quick fixes
- Obvious bugs with simple solutions
- When already in a feature workspace
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I debug production issues safely?">
1. Create a workspace for the debug effort
2. Add logging/diagnostics without deployment
3. Test fixes thoroughly
4. Review changes before rebasing
5. Deploy after full test verification
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When should I use @Verifier instead of the main agent?">
Use @Verifier for quick validation checks, syntax verification, and pre-commit checks. Use the main agent for complex investigations requiring full context.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can Verdent debug code it didn't write?">
Yes. Describe the bug and use @-mentions to point Verdent to relevant files. Verdent analyzes the code regardless of who wrote it.
</Accordion>
