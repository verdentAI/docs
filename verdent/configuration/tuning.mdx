title: Configuration Optimization
description: "Optimize Verdent for speed, cost, and thoroughness"
---

Optimize Verdent to balance speed, cost, and thoroughness based on your workflow requirements.

### Optimization Areas

- Model selection for cost and performance balance
- Execution mode configuration for workflow efficiency
- Context management for large codebases
- Per-project and workspace-level customization

---

## Speed vs Thoroughness Tradeoffs

Balance execution speed against analysis depth based on task requirements.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Speed-Critical">
    **Configuration:**
    - **Model:** Claude Haiku 4.5 (fast, cost-efficient)
    - **Execution Mode:** Agent Mode for direct execution
    - **Use Cases:** Quick fixes, routine operations, simple tasks

    **Benefits:**
    - Fastest response times
    - Minimal interruptions
    - Lower credit consumption
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Thoroughness-Critical">
    **Configuration:**
    - **Model:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 1M (extended context)
    - **Execution Mode:** Plan Mode for strategic review
    - **Use Cases:** Complex features, production code, architectural decisions

    **Benefits:**
    - Maximum context window (1M tokens)
    - Complete visibility and control
    - Review before execution
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Hybrid Approach">
    Most users benefit from context-switching between configurations:

    - **Quick fixes:** Haiku + Agent Mode
    - **Complex features:** Sonnet + Plan Mode
    - **Exploration:** Plan Mode for strategy, then Agent Mode for execution

    **Strategy:** Adapt configuration to task type instead of using one-size-fits-all approach.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Project-Specific Configuration

### Project Rules (AGENTS.md)

- **Location:** Project root directory or workspace folder
- **Scope:** Applied only to the current project
- **Version Control:** Commit to git for team-wide standards
- **Content:** Coding standards, testing requirements, architectural patterns

**Example:**

```markdown filename="AGENTS.md"
# Project Rules

## Code Standards
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Generate unit tests for all new functions
- Follow MVC pattern

## Testing
- All endpoints require input validation
- Run tests before committing
```

### Configuration Priority

When configurations conflict, Verdent applies this priority order:

1. **Project Rules (AGENTS.md)** - Highest priority (project-specific)
2. **Workspace Settings** - Application workspace-level settings
3. **User Rules** - Global user preferences (Settings → User Rules)
4. **Default Settings** - Verdent's built-in defaults

## Context Management for Large Projects

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Subagents">
    - Delegate complex operations to subagents with separate context windows
    - Only subagent results consume main context, not entire process
    - Prevents main context from filling with implementation details
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="File Selection">
    - Explicitly add only relevant files using `@filename`
    - Avoid loading entire project into context unnecessarily
    - Target specific components for focused analysis
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Task Chunking">
    - Break large tasks into smaller, completable chunks
    - Start new sessions for distinct features or components
    - Natural breakpoints prevent context depletion
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Plan Mode">
    - Review approach before consuming execution context
    - Reduces wasted context on incorrect implementations
    - Plan Mode has separate context management
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
Multi-workspace scenarios automatically apply appropriate project rules when switching workspaces. No manual configuration switching required.
</Note>

## Desktop-Specific Optimization

### Parallel Agent Efficiency

Verdent's parallel execution capability requires optimization consideration:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Resource Allocation">
    **When Running Multiple Agents:**
    - Each agent maintains independent context
    - CPU and memory usage scales with active agents
    - Network requests parallelize for faster completion

    **Optimization:**
    - Limit concurrent agents on resource-constrained machines
    - Use Claude Haiku 4.5 for routine parallel tasks
    - Reserve Claude Sonnet 4.5 for complex individual tasks
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Workspace Distribution">
    **Git Workspace Strategy:**
    - Each workspace provides full file isolation
    - Agents in separate workspaces never conflict
    - Base workspace serves as reference

    **Optimization:**
    - Group related tasks in the same workspace
    - Create dedicated workspaces for long-running features
    - Clean up completed workspaces to free resources
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Performance Optimization

### Model Selection Strategy

| Task Type | Recommended Model | Reason |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Quick fixes | Claude Haiku 4.5 | Speed and cost |
| General development | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Best tradeoff |
| Complex architecture | Claude Sonnet 4.5 1M | Extended context |
| Parallel routine tasks | Claude Haiku 4.5 | Resource efficiency |

### Execution Mode Strategy

| Scenario | Recommended Mode | Reason |
|----------|------------------|--------|
| Learning new codebase | Plan Mode | Safe exploration |
| Active development | Agent Mode | Full capabilities |
| Production changes | Plan Mode first | Review before execution |

## Cost Optimization

### Credit Efficiency

Balance credit consumption against productivity:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Cost Reduction">
    **Strategies:**
    - Use Claude Haiku 4.5 for routine tasks (lower credit consumption)
    - Use `@Verifier` for quick validation (separate context)
    - Break large tasks into smaller sessions

## FAQs

<Accordion title="How do I optimize for large codebases?">
Large codebase optimization strategies:

1. **Use subagents strategically:** `@Verifier` and `@Code-reviewer` preserve main context
2. **Read files selectively:** Use `@filename` for specific files only
3. **Chunk large tasks:** Break features into smaller, focused sessions
4. **Use Plan Mode first:** Plan approach before consuming execution context
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the best configuration for team collaboration?">
**Recommended team configuration:**

- **Project Rules (AGENTS.md):** Commit shared coding standards
- **Plan Mode for changes:** Review approach before execution
- **Auto Generate Code Review:** Enable for quality assurance

This balances productivity with code review needs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do parallel agents affect performance?">
**Resource impact:**

- **CPU:** Linear scaling with active agents
- **Memory:** Each agent maintains separate context
- **Network:** Parallel API requests

**Optimization:**
- 2-3 concurrent agents optimal for most machines
- Use Claude Haiku 4.5 for parallel tasks
- Monitor system resources during heavy parallel work
