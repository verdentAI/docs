## What You'll Learn

This section covers Verdent's power-user capabilities including subagent management, rule systems, tool integration, parallel execution, and advanced extensibility options.

---

## Complex Feature Explanations

Verdent provides sophisticated features that enable advanced development workflows beyond basic code generation.

### Subagent System

**Specialized AI Agents:**
Verdent includes built-in subagents: `@Verifier` for code verification and quick checks, and `@Code-reviewer` for code quality assessment. Subagents operate with isolated context windows and custom system prompts, specializing in specific tasks.

**Manual Invocation:**
Use @-mentions to invoke subagents (e.g., `@Verifier check this function` or `@Code-reviewer review this authentication flow`). This delegation preserves main context while handling specialized operations efficiently.

### Rule Systems

**Behavior Customization:**
Rule files guide Verdent's behavior, output formatting, and decision-making through plain Markdown documents. Two rule types control different scopes:

- **user_rules.md** - Global personal preferences across all projects (Settings → User Rules)
- **AGENTS.md** - Project-specific team standards (version controlled)

**Rule Precedence:**
When conflicts occur, project rules (`AGENTS.md`) override user rules, ensuring team consistency while preserving personal preferences for solo projects.

### Tool System & MCP

**Built-in Tools:**
Verdent provides comprehensive tools for file operations, search (`glob`/`grep`), command execution (`bash`), web access, and agent delegation. Tools enable all code manipulation, navigation, and external interaction.

**Model Context Protocol (MCP):**
MCP extends Verdent's capabilities by connecting to external tools, data sources, and services. Configure MCP servers through Settings → MCP Servers to integrate project-specific APIs and custom functionality.

## Multi-Agent Coordination

Verdent's multi-subagent architecture enables parallel task execution with automatic routing and coordination.

**Main Agent (Orchestrator):**
The primary agent analyzes requests, breaks down complex tasks, and delegates specialized work to subagents while maintaining conversation context and consolidating results.

**Parallel Execution:**
Multiple agents can run concurrently in separate workspaces. Each workspace has its own isolated environment, enabling true parallel development without conflicts.

**Context Isolation:**
Each agent operates with its own context window. This isolation prevents context exhaustion during multi-step operations and ensures parallel work doesn't interfere.

**Subagent Usage:**
Built-in subagents can be invoked for specialized tasks:
- Validation checks → `@Verifier`
- Code quality review → `@Code-reviewer`

## Desktop-Specific Advanced Features

### Parallel Agents in Workspaces

Verdent uniquely supports running multiple AI agents simultaneously across git workspaces (worktrees):

| Feature | Capability |
|---------|------------|
| **Independent Agents** | Each workspace can have its own active agent |
| **Isolated Contexts** | Agents don't share context between workspaces |
| **Parallel Execution** | Work on multiple features simultaneously |
| **Coordinated Rebasing** | Review and rebase parallel work to master |

### Advanced Context Management

Desktop-specific context optimization:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Workspace Strategy">
    - Use separate workspaces for independent features
    - Each workspace maintains isolated context
    - Rebase to master when features are complete
    - Clean up workspaces to free resources
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Subagent Delegation">
    - Use `@Verifier` for quick validation and code checks
    - Use `@Code-reviewer` for security and quality review
    - Reserve main context for active development
    - Subagent results consume minimal main context
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Task Management">
    - Start fresh tasks for new features
    - Complete task → review → rebase → new task
    - Clear stale context by starting new tasks
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Custom Workflow Creation

Advanced users can customize Verdent's behavior to match team processes and project requirements.

**Rule-Based Customization:**
Define coding standards, testing requirements, and output preferences through rule files:
- Enforce team conventions (indentation, naming, patterns)
- Specify documentation styles and comment detail levels
- Configure user preferences globally or per-project

**Extensibility Through MCP:**
Integrate external tools and services:
- Database query tools
- Cloud service APIs (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Project management integrations (Jira, Linear)
- CI/CD pipeline connections
